gtkvncviewer~~~1295185404~~~jamesmvp~~~2~~~I couldn't get it to work, wouldn't start in Mint so used SSVNC which has a little more functions but seems to be far more stable and compatible with Remote desktop

gtkvncviewer~~~1301313624~~~johanjohnsson~~~2~~~Really bad performance, even on local. Dont know if it can be that my server computer is using an ATI graphic card.

gtypist~~~1296683071~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Very good for a command-line typing tutor. I used this a while over other GUI typing tutors before I found a graphical one I prefered a bit more.
gtypist~~~1332686239~~~rajes4india~~~5~~~really a needed app ..
gtypist~~~1393661487~~~stevenkw~~~5~~~This really is the best typing trainer available. Mavis Beacon should be ashamed.
gtypist~~~1407737906~~~crimsonmane~~~3~~~This is what you would use in a keyboarding class to learn proper typing. This one runs in terminal so it will work on any system &#40;there will not be a menu entry&#41;. This tutor does not track progress and doesn't let you pick up where you left off. The menus are daunting as they include too much information. Klavaro is better by leaps and bounds.
gtypist~~~1440954826~~~QtlyOptmstc~~~5~~~Absolutely great! My favorite typing tutor by far. This has two modes of operation, normal and speed, in which the user overwrites the lesson text. Performance is stored via the -b option, which display's each lesson's personal best. I REALLY like the quotes and literary passages in the optional lessons. What's nice about gytpist is that new lessons can be created either using the existing lessons (see the lesson folder's .typ files) as templates or googling the file format. I can see several languages are supported. I did find many of the english lessons expected a US keyboard, so it's worth spotting this and modifying the .typ file to match your own layout. It's written in C, and was fairly straightforward to make a few mods.
guacamole-tomcat~~~1457486910~~~robeirne~~~3~~~It works but needs to be updated to the latest version (0.9.?) to allow use on portable devices
guake~~~1271324333~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Ohne Guake wäre mein Linux Mint nichts wert. Ich hoffe, es findet den Weg in die Standardinstallation. So hat man mit F12 jederzeit ein Terminalfenster und ist handlungsfähig, selbst wenn man mal keine Maus oder ein Touchpad zur Hand hat. Tip: Rechts anklicken und automatisch mitstarten lassen.
guake~~~1273066226~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~My favorite Linux terminal. It drops down with a hotkey, it has a nice transparency, tabs. This is a part of my default installs as well.
guake~~~1309754581~~~opensas~~~5~~~can't live without
guake~~~1274244986~~~hustletrees~~~5~~~smooth, quick, and becomes indispensible after even a few hours of usage.

guake~~~1274250527~~~huntman~~~5~~~number 1
guake~~~1274448347~~~conf~~~5~~~no need for all the shells floating helplessly around your virtual desktops. guake is extremely convenient while looking good at the same time, simply a must have. KDE users look for yakuake (however i don't like its appearance)
guake~~~1274895455~~~afriza~~~5~~~I love it. It provides easy access to the terminal without clutter
guake~~~1275092897~~~mafarevx~~~5~~~gorgeous
guake~~~1275158527~~~sede~~~5~~~must have!
guake~~~1275483926~~~bqdbr~~~5~~~Great app, must have.

guake~~~1276946695~~~detelinka~~~5~~~very practical
guake~~~1276947059~~~ponpat~~~5~~~best terminal I know
guake~~~1276965421~~~vipek~~~4~~~Good. But could slide from top (like I saw it in KDE); and when you go out from fullscreen, the terminal doesn't expand to the whole screen width.
guake~~~1277410914~~~Twiguard~~~5~~~Lots of settings. Like it very much. ^^
guake~~~1323997120~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I like it! :) The bug that bugged me before is now fixed. :)
guake~~~1278255941~~~ketanf~~~5~~~on my gnome or lxde installations this is the bomb.
guake~~~1282079828~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I liked it so much earlier because of it is elegant but since I have been using terminator it is no more my favorite terminal.
guake~~~1283275881~~~Wicho~~~5~~~Very quick, nice and practiical!
guake~~~1283954267~~~glo0m~~~5~~~Very practical!! I made it appear/hide by an top-left-edge mouse event (compiz) :)
guake~~~1284272221~~~thrillseeker~~~5~~~Love it! It's both practical, and cool-looking/fun to use. I set it to the...key that looks like this ' that I can longer type with... I got used to it from Oblivion, and it's easier to reach. I think this will encourange me to learn and use the command line more.
guake~~~1284485870~~~gesthal~~~5~~~really useful.
guake~~~1284495098~~~ozos~~~5~~~I love it, It's so useful
guake~~~1288448091~~~kreativeone~~~5~~~Extremely useful. Well done design with all the right options. Be sure to change the transparency on the Appearance tab, otherwise the default will be difficult to read depending on your screen background.
guake~~~1289235624~~~hellangel~~~5~~~like it!
guake~~~1289236814~~~tdockery97~~~2~~~I don't see a need.  Right-click on desktop and open Terminal.  Is that hard?
guake~~~1289650734~~~nebjak~~~5~~~The best!
guake~~~1289789786~~~hexram~~~5~~~Very nice feature set.
guake~~~1290904375~~~yagolf~~~5~~~never went back to the normal terminal after trying this
guake~~~1290103633~~~nipapoo~~~4~~~love it but it keeps bugging up with transparency issues :(
guake~~~1290407645~~~killmess~~~5~~~Imprescindible! Buenisimo si sos de usar la consola a cada rato ( con Control+T abris otra pestaña) ;)
guake~~~1292373151~~~Shostako~~~5~~~Don't need another terminal, useful and pretty.
guake~~~1294174532~~~9littlebees~~~5~~~Be sure to set it to load at startup and spend a little time tweaking its preferences - you won't be disappointed!
guake~~~1294838180~~~L0r3nz0~~~4~~~It's nice to have a terminal which is quickly to be opened

guake~~~1295481057~~~kindjal~~~5~~~Impressive ! Very useful ! Great idea, i never thought of it
guake~~~1296521258~~~mr_yurka~~~5~~~Just love it! After tweaking it a bit, I realized that having a functional "terminal background" is what I missed all the time before!
guake~~~1297076308~~~quaie~~~5~~~I found it by mistake while browsing the best rated packages and I find it  - EXQUISIT! keeping the terminals stacked in one pop-out window is very useful (at least for me)
guake~~~1298198798~~~mactar~~~4~~~mactar très pratique
guake~~~1298403591~~~novecento~~~5~~~I love it. It's really useful.

guake~~~1314752905~~~danstinebaugh~~~5~~~Love how easy it is to get to a terminal window now, Great Stuff!
guake~~~1304350381~~~arturobandini~~~5~~~really like it
guake~~~1304783420~~~smroose73~~~5~~~This is a must have for the cronic-customizer.  Just hit f12 and a transparent terminal comes up so you can apt-get install to your hearts content.  Fully customizable to fit whatever style you have at the moment.  Should be a default.
guake~~~1305408219~~~Zenettii~~~5~~~Possibly the most useful tool in my GUI environment. Rebind the standard F12 key to the key next to '1' (not 2! the otherside)
guake~~~1306543497~~~wother~~~4~~~Love it. Especially as I am loving the terminal more and more.
guake~~~1306869913~~~slw_~~~4~~~Quite handy; discrete and pretty. I like it a lot.

guake~~~1308078336~~~zacklyke~~~5~~~As smroose73 said, if you're heavy on the apt-get install you must get it. I love it.
guake~~~1311265317~~~tsagas~~~5~~~Guake is great for us CLI junkies :-)
guake~~~1312991015~~~thewilson~~~5~~~Super Convenient, too transparent by default, Great!
guake~~~1318971066~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~like it
guake~~~1314818593~~~piedpipr~~~5~~~This program has ruined the way I look at terminals.  I refuse to use anything but this.
guake~~~1314821567~~~trollboy~~~3~~~I used to love this but having gnome terminal embedded in my desktop using Compiz is soooo much cooler
guake~~~1316028534~~~Rafson~~~4~~~hmm it's just drop down terminal ... byt still can't live without it :)
guake~~~1317069314~~~bblonski~~~5~~~Really convenient if you use the CLI a lot.  Decent customization options, but could be better.
guake~~~1318704069~~~phucluoi~~~4~~~A must have for linux power user
guake~~~1319812358~~~cirx~~~5~~~Very handy! Unobtrusive. Appearance is highly configurable to fit an elegantl desktop, too.
guake~~~1320780707~~~chassum~~~4~~~Especially useful when you need a quick terminal while reading something in your browser.
guake~~~1320921236~~~mckie~~~4~~~Can't stay without it. But I think it needs the unlimited scrolling option.
guake~~~1321564848~~~nicord~~~5~~~love it!
guake~~~1321802119~~~iGRed~~~5~~~Really handy!
guake~~~1359549097~~~ringe~~~4~~~I'm addicted to this. The constant availability and out-of-focus features are very handy when multitasking.

guake~~~1323079145~~~axeoth~~~5~~~It is always there when you need it.
guake~~~1324081259~~~infog~~~5~~~Awesome app!
guake~~~1324129165~~~Oppression~~~4~~~I think that it would be better if it included ready commands for help
guake~~~1325526527~~~antolieztsu~~~5~~~Very useful software! I use all the time with vim and ranger.
guake~~~1326048709~~~befast~~~4~~~Tweek indispensable !

guake~~~1348462438~~~tao_hunter~~~5~~~it's a great gui tab enabled terminal !
guake~~~1349111996~~~jadykes~~~5~~~Intuitive; should become a more common way of accessing terminals.
guake~~~1350743712~~~geoffm~~~4~~~Interface could be improved a little bit, but a drop-down terminal is a must-have

guake~~~1352636880~~~navo~~~5~~~very useful !
guake~~~1403253029~~~RytronII~~~5~~~I wish it had a drag and drop text feature.
guake~~~1354893524~~~abcd~~~1~~~Many years after I first tried it, Guake still does not support multi-monitor setups. Use Yakuake instead if you have multiple desktops.

guake~~~1360021508~~~Sogal~~~5~~~Vraiment parfait pour ceux qui utilisent le terminal toutes les 2 sec dans leur environnement graphique. Installation propre et sans bavure sur Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon, fonctionnement parfait et fluide. Les options de personnalisations sont intéressantes.

guake~~~1364306128~~~desynced~~~5~~~This should be a default package in Linux Mint.  A must have.
guake~~~1365100417~~~millerii~~~5~~~Great one! If you use less or more terminal, anyway most one.
guake~~~1365869921~~~patrickcage~~~5~~~This is too handy to not be included by default!!
guake~~~1366334922~~~disPPlay~~~5~~~I love the drop-down terminal style. For me the best terminal for Linux Mint.

guake~~~1381052403~~~quake0~~~5~~~Just like quake! Great!
guake~~~1382334697~~~withallduerespect~~~5~~~Really handy terminal. One note - if you have dual monitors, track down the updated guake preferences app, which allows you to specify which monitor it will appear on.
guake~~~1382914801~~~StanleyTweedle~~~5~~~Великолепно! Вся мощь Линукс в "игровой" консоли... прекраснее не придумаешь!
guake~~~1385832061~~~seelensturm~~~5~~~Ein Wort: Coooooool ;-)

guake~~~1404371017~~~kaykutalp~~~5~~~SUper
guake~~~1404499578~~~joseph8th~~~5~~~Love it! Only terminal I've used for years.
guake~~~1404703103~~~oakd~~~5~~~Essential. The terminal I almost always use.
guake~~~1406437303~~~rmascorro~~~5~~~This is always the first program I install on a new system.
guake~~~1407223019~~~ttjimera~~~4~~~This is more practical and neat than having several terminal windows lying around on the desktop. It would be nice, however, to be able to save and restore the terminals, or at least the name of the terminals. Why allow user to rename the terminals but not allow them the option to save it?
guake~~~1408038860~~~0dysseus~~~5~~~Originally just had a terminal start after Gnome, but this is quality.
guake~~~1409681416~~~taytayevanson~~~5~~~I use this all day, every day! Super handy.
guake~~~1409704842~~~Rebel450~~~2~~~mhmmm   really ?   the taskbar is doing better (for me so far)
guake~~~1412277431~~~StormBeast~~~5~~~The most useful tool on linux imo. Should come installed by default. Can't live without it now.
guake~~~1414449725~~~robsku~~~4~~~Not mocking this, quite the opposite, it's good to have when underlying window manager is lacking (precisely WM, desktop environment itself need not to change to fix the shortcomings, for example replacing Gnomes official WM with another, fluxbox, if you know how to configure it correctly, is fine example). What I mean is that IMHO a WM without ability to assign a hotkey with hide/show action to a specific applications window - or specific window only - is very lacking. Proper WM should be able to let you define hotkeys for groups of windows as well as any one individual window. This program solves the problem only for one type of application, but it does just that perfectly fine so it deserves good rating. Also, it only solves the hide/show action part, while the lacking of WM is not that, it's lack of any action that however is available for the currently active window. I have this installed, for I have need to work on DE+WM other than my default (i3) now and then, and am grateful for it.
guake~~~1414751415~~~sacio~~~5~~~Very nice and handy drop-down terminal!
guake~~~1416408195~~~Transilvanec~~~5~~~the best of the best
guake~~~1419756282~~~fuzzyanalysis~~~2~~~Gets in the way a bit.  Prefer to just use a hot key for opening gnome-terminal, myself.
guake~~~1420143469~~~ka4a~~~5~~~nice tool
guake~~~1420369772~~~gothicpreston~~~5~~~Always good to have this sat in the background for when I need to run a Bash utility or get some system info. Another of my essential applications to install on a new box!
guake~~~1422667080~~~ajiegs~~~5~~~One of very usefull tool :)
guake~~~1426020208~~~manole~~~4~~~xqz! so nice and usefull

guake~~~1441386169~~~novo1987~~~5~~~1*
guake~~~1444397203~~~aplatypus~~~1~~~Not configurable; also wastes MOST of my screen.  I can put a hot-key on most things; so no special value to me.
guake~~~1444509863~~~benjy~~~3~~~Ok but missing featues such as multiple sessions which YAKUAKE offers
guake~~~1448985898~~~nguyenminhnhan91~~~5~~~It's awesome because at this moment there's no app that has function like this. I hope that the developer will make guake more flexible by allowing it to be located anywhere as expected.
guake~~~1450725823~~~NaruTrey~~~5~~~Это действительно удобно!
guake~~~1454873367~~~CPAllianceP~~~3~~~Yakuake's better.
guake~~~1456182726~~~mazebane~~~5~~~One of the first utils i install on a new build. Love the transparency when reading what repository to use form the webpage underneath it. Can have multiple terminals by clicking on icon in bottom right corner.

guarddog~~~1294928130~~~miana~~~2~~~it prevents me from installing my touchpad. I don't know how the easiest way to be superuser whatever, so I guess it's not user friendly like zonealarm in windows. Had to remove it. Muah...
guayadeque~~~1348147330~~~farocker~~~5~~~Superb Player! Fast and funky! ;)
guayadeque~~~1323398941~~~jajodo~~~5~~~Light and fast.  Works well with large libraries.  With smart play you only have to pick one song and guayadeque will automatically continue picking and playing similar songs from your library.
guayadeque~~~1324146172~~~rockandroleo~~~3~~~Porgrama liviano, con buena interfaz, buenas opciones y funcionalidades, etc. Sería perfecto si no se cayera a cada rato. Si mejoran este detalle de estabilidad, pasaría a ser uno de los buenos reproductores de música.
guayadeque~~~1324503848~~~Kain~~~5~~~By far my favorite music player!
guayadeque~~~1325599221~~~vetz_cro~~~4~~~Very nice and functional music player. Works well and I like it!
guayadeque~~~1327789758~~~vella~~~5~~~Fantastic!
guayadeque~~~1331573344~~~apoinssot~~~5~~~Best player I've ever used. Much better than Banshee or Rhythmbox, and even better than foobar2000
guayadeque~~~1332147684~~~kamecat~~~5~~~Internet radio ,custom layout and Lyrics .....great! This is the best player ever.
guayadeque~~~1333376693~~~renzo22~~~4~~~very nice!
guayadeque~~~1336175808~~~ptrvio~~~5~~~MI reproductor preferido, trae informacion del artista de internet (last.fm), las letras de los temas, caratulas de los CD's, pode scargar multiples fuentes de musicas. Excelente.
guayadeque~~~1342435077~~~legodfrey~~~5~~~Really good shuffle function, and copes well with large libraries
guayadeque~~~1350075075~~~arvislacis~~~4~~~Works very fast and is stable but sometimes has some bugs.
guayadeque~~~1361099993~~~niks~~~5~~~I found this in a distro of Peppermint and liked the radio support and it's speed ......it's is brilliant please make it default mintys
guayadeque~~~1356554077~~~Nayllko~~~5~~~Tout ce qu'on peut attendre d'un lecteur moderne. Interface un peu austère et vieillote, mais très fonctionnelle. La gestion de la médiathèque et des playlist est un régal. Merci aux devs ;o)
guayadeque~~~1359705505~~~vlado4~~~5~~~Thank you for shoutcast!
guayadeque~~~1362934095~~~badbrainsg~~~5~~~Using on Linux Mint 14. Works beautifully, including radio stations. Not a memory hog.
guayadeque~~~1364505516~~~theguy~~~5~~~Absolutely fantastic, so glad I ran into this.
guayadeque~~~1365944567~~~frombenny~~~5~~~Je l'ai vu évoluer au fil des années. Même si le développement s'est beaucoup ralenti ces derniers temps, je continue de l'installer systématiquement..
guayadeque~~~1366127091~~~demaniak~~~5~~~Does what it is supposed to, based on my (very unscientific an casual) tests, consumes about half the memory and 3/4 CPU of  Clementine (whcih is also very good btw!)
guayadeque~~~1366428829~~~JBRR25~~~5~~~I just love this player, the built-in lyrics feature is awesome
guayadeque~~~1371661291~~~lordamit~~~5~~~Simple, lovely, and awesome. That's guayadeque. It simply works. :)
guayadeque~~~1372160442~~~marinad~~~5~~~Very nice, simple and useful. Finally I found an adequate analogue of foobar2000
guayadeque~~~1378872022~~~Old-Techie~~~5~~~Simple to use.  Most players I've tried haven't been able to cope with the extent of my music collection, most are unable to show the full directory listings.  Guayadeqe does it without any undue delays.  Love the lyrics function, and the tabbed interface helps keep clutter down.  It is very responsive and with my quick tests it seems to have a smaller memory footprint and lower average cpu useage that most others I've tried.
guayadeque~~~1379108343~~~driguez~~~5~~~Exelente Reproductor
guayadeque~~~1384168889~~~nika_wska~~~5~~~My fav music player on linux ;) Playlist, radio, library. Nice interface, clean & easy
guayadeque~~~1391976500~~~phramusca~~~5~~~Le meilleur
guayadeque~~~1394621107~~~piekasso~~~5~~~Finally found a match for windows foobar2000, has filesystem browser, library database, radio, many audioformats and is lightweight!
guayadeque~~~1395999173~~~mezuss~~~5~~~With some more work on it - might be a good equivalent for those like me who miss foobar
guayadeque~~~1400363416~~~Armatten~~~5~~~Понравился только этот.
guayadeque~~~1400950976~~~Inhabitans~~~5~~~Excellent, versatile music player for large collections...
guayadeque~~~1402937736~~~BorisXp~~~5~~~Best Player on Linux ever, tried all other players but Guayadeque is the best,, i was so glad when i found this awesome app
guayadeque~~~1405171186~~~hosen12~~~5~~~Best player on linux!
guayadeque~~~1405802494~~~mlsmith~~~5~~~Incredibly lightweight but powerful...excellent software!
guayadeque~~~1414691262~~~sudhi_nair735~~~5~~~best in the business
guayadeque~~~1424813198~~~fresh_user~~~5~~~My favourite music player at this moment. Love the functionality and integrated tunein radio stations. Jamendo and Magnatune can leave quite a big cache files (700mb) if you choose all the genres
guayadeque~~~1434528781~~~fotonix~~~4~~~Well organized interface, many features to find and explore.
guayadeque~~~1436482401~~~brab777~~~5~~~The best music player I have found!
guayadeque~~~1438156415~~~theoswald~~~5~~~Sin duda el mejor reproductor, ligero, organizado, fácil de usar... y con las mejores listas automáticas. Es una pena que no se siga desarrollando.
guayadeque~~~1439558309~~~MusicMaster~~~5~~~Really glad i tried this player. I think it's awesome and i'm gonna stick with this one.
guayadeque~~~1441457106~~~yashletn~~~2~~~Vraiment pas ergonomique
guayadeque~~~1444246818~~~gruslo~~~5~~~I use it only for shoutcast radio player and does perfectly its job: you can select from hundreds internet radios and listen to the music you like, while working on the computer. Perfect!
guayadeque~~~1452898208~~~have~~~5~~~Really the best music player for Linux I have used.
gucharmap~~~1288727187~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Not the simpliest character map to navigate, but it has a search feature that helps, and boy is it ever full of selections!
gucharmap~~~1327196607~~~Riao~~~4~~~Great little app for what it does.
gucharmap~~~1334328108~~~ulysses~~~3~~~Helpful. But I almost never find what I need.
gucharmap~~~1410305222~~~WhitePhoenix~~~5~~~The search makes it easy to find the character you need when you cannot remember or figure out which group it is in. Lots of groups, but that is what makes it complete.
gucharmap~~~1413713668~~~Bob_VM~~~4~~~Interface is better than Win, but hard to find many unicode characters.
gucharmap~~~1443949786~~~iosonoscrive~~~4~~~Good
gufw~~~1270988998~~~Roin~~~5~~~Very nice GUI for UFW, It makes it possible for really everybody to activate and setup a firewall :).
gufw~~~1271328886~~~captainhaggy~~~3~~~Eine grafische Bedienung für die hauseigene Firewall. Leider ersetzt dieses Tool nicht den Sachverstand, den man beim Aufsetzen einer Firewall benötigt, von daher wäre es durchaus ratsamer, das Kommandozeilenprogramm ufw zu benutzen, es ist in meinen Augen verständlicher und schneller. Viel schneller.
gufw~~~1271587266~~~distrohopper~~~5~~~Makes setting up a firewall a breeze. It's not full of over-technical jargon.
gufw~~~1271812643~~~maty1206~~~4~~~Finally, a real GUI for iptables. Very easy to use, light and intuitive.  Recommended for newbies.
gufw~~~1276349766~~~Rich_Roast~~~4~~~Perfect for a quick and effective firewall
gufw~~~1286034865~~~ceptor~~~5~~~leicht zubedienendes graphisches frontend fuer iptables. damit laesst sich in kuerze ein ordentlicher schutz fuer den desktop-pc oder das notebook gestalten.

gufw~~~1313097191~~~galen~~~4~~~you are a MORON if you do not use firewall

gufw~~~1319088274~~~wtlhk~~~5~~~Works great
gufw~~~1319233897~~~new2nix~~~4~~~good firewall. does not cover scope rules worth a pooh, but is easy for begginers and quick for vets. People who do not use a firewall are just ASKing to be taken over. Very literally.
gufw~~~1323470587~~~daeme~~~4~~~very easy to use gui for ufw.
gufw~~~1335604517~~~crismblog~~~5~~~excellent

gufw~~~1346089559~~~dinosb~~~4~~~Simple and straightforward. Very good to use.

gufw~~~1370385219~~~taz0813~~~3~~~excellent, easy to use..
gufw~~~1388514614~~~Arucardo~~~1~~~Doesn't do anything, all options are grayed out, can't even select the off/on button.
gufw~~~1390671617~~~Janusz~~~5~~~Prosty w obsłudze - chyba również skuteczny
gufw~~~1392524890~~~ravenheart~~~5~~~Simple and effective.  Just click the Status button and in a few seconds, it will turn on.  I guess the fellow who gave it one star couldn't figure out how to click a button.
gufw~~~1397604987~~~chrismots~~~5~~~Let the good data roll!

gufw~~~1414451003~~~gunhilldillz~~~5~~~Simple and useful.

gufw~~~1431094392~~~Juan-Guillermo~~~5~~~Me gusta.
gufw~~~1430842510~~~jijames~~~5~~~Simple and easy to use.
gufw~~~1432124070~~~deanmires~~~4~~~seems to work fairly well
gufw~~~1436430843~~~gdk2008uk~~~5~~~this is not installed by default in Cinnamon is is sumhow causing a conflict with a built in firewall
gufw~~~1438445724~~~Mehmet~~~4~~~Daha iyi olabilirdi. Cinnamon ile öntanımlı gelse güzel olur.
gufw~~~1439820766~~~ManuelMB~~~3~~~It needs to show and let you control all the concrete traffic that is taking place. If somebody has used Comodo firewall, already knows what I mean.
gufw~~~1440502071~~~michaldybczak~~~5~~~It should be default part of the system
gufw~~~1442986749~~~Turist~~~4~~~Ok!
gufw~~~1444243265~~~Sentalin~~~5~~~Works fine!
gufw~~~1444754973~~~arno08~~~4~~~Simple à utiliser et fait bien son travail

gufw~~~1451651283~~~Trage~~~5~~~Top A +++++
gufw~~~1453422235~~~abuibrahim~~~5~~~First thing to install ! Must have ! Never had issues with it !
gufw~~~1453776203~~~balcobulls~~~5~~~When you say perfect for any user, it normally means there is no advanced features.  Not so fast my friend, Gufw truely is for all users, beginner to the person who needs full control!
gummi~~~1306722478~~~sinapsis~~~5~~~My favorite LaTex editor: it's simple and has a real time viewer.
gummi~~~1317575275~~~carlosjimy~~~3~~~Va bien, es útil para algunos trabajos de edición, sobre todo con su vista en tiempo real del documento en PDF
gummi~~~1339862589~~~johanA~~~5~~~Second that. Really efficient and no clutter. Love it!
gummi~~~1375099781~~~hobboy~~~5~~~Excellent application for beginners to latex, I've found it very helpful to be able to see the live update, especially which experimenting with what macros do
gummi~~~1388059719~~~thibo~~~5~~~really good, especially for beginners
gummi~~~1455290248~~~MagicMint~~~2~~~The idea itself is good, however the implementation is too simplistic. Thus many documents that are handled without an error by TeXstudio must be “corrected” here manually before they can be displayed – which greatly diminishes Gummi’s suitability for beginners. For that purpose, LyX is much more appropriate.
gunroar~~~1281254206~~~Mito~~~5~~~Very good game! Nice graphics!
gunroar~~~1281815478~~~linux1492~~~1~~~Keeps you a minute or two asking what is coming next and then you wish you'd taken another game to entertain yourself. I would not recommendate it to download. But then again if you are a fan of pressing a fire button and do mechanical movements it might be fun.
gunroar~~~1439127207~~~discolust~~~5~~~I LOVE this game. It's a beautiful bullet-hell that can go on and on and on. Way to go, Kenta Cho!!
guvcview~~~1276992413~~~atlanx~~~5~~~Wunderbares Programm um seine (UVC-)Webcamera (z.b. von Logitech) einzustellen und zu verwenden.e
guvcview~~~1278588228~~~pbmuk~~~5~~~Very good. Clear, responsive controls
guvcview~~~1303081707~~~reborn777~~~5~~~Smooth!
guvcview~~~1307312086~~~jmorillov~~~5~~~smooth, beautiful, awesome. Excellent job.
guvcview~~~1308654999~~~Kuchum~~~5~~~Для Acer TravelMate - незаменимая вещь
guvcview~~~1310282173~~~Elisa~~~5~~~I've found this works best for me, much better than cheese and all functions work ok ;)
guvcview~~~1316403353~~~cdaaawg~~~5~~~Easy to install, easy to use. It just works. I love GNU/Linux and open source software. Thank you developers.
guvcview~~~1316815840~~~glubbar~~~5~~~Simply excellent!
guvcview~~~1317167888~~~robertochile87~~~4~~~funciona bien
guvcview~~~1318180376~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~It is recommended !!!!!!!!Veeeery nice One !
guvcview~~~1318868188~~~Lampyris~~~5~~~Very clean and useful program, Thank you!
guvcview~~~1322650599~~~tohans~~~5~~~Great software, it simply works, clear controls, thnks programmers.   Installed on Acer laptop 7720z + linux mint 12
guvcview~~~1324137924~~~nuniruro~~~3~~~Better than Cheese, but looks bad. Bad system theme integration. It's also a bit hard to use, I had to configure it by myself. It also overwrites the last file if you don't change the filename. However - when set up, it works really good, and records video as good as in Windows (my camera is made for Windows). I can not see this version replace Cheese, but if the problems I listed with guvcview are fixed, I see no reason in keeping Cheese as the default software in later distribuations.
guvcview~~~1334466456~~~mysoomro~~~3~~~It seems to be a nice program. But I'm having a problem. When I click on capt.video, the application turns off.
guvcview~~~1344129133~~~wirotela~~~4~~~It very powerfull, I like the cope with power line handle.
guvcview~~~1346094257~~~michelsaey~~~5~~~Very nice!
guvcview~~~1347186365~~~akabanekuroido~~~4~~~The only software which was able to digitize my analogue video's by using the Terratec G1 video capture device. I used version 1.6 though, cause its supports Pulsaudio.
guvcview~~~1352888316~~~RytronII~~~5~~~Far better than Cheese.
guvcview~~~1356738663~~~mintwalker~~~5~~~Sehr gutes Tool um kurz mal ein Video aufzunehmen oder schnell mal ein Bild machen. Es sind auch ein paar Filter für Videos und Effekte für Audio eingebaut. Empfehlung!!!
guvcview~~~1358144037~~~vamsivadrevu~~~5~~~Have used it on Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04(laptop), 12.10 and now I've gotta try it on Linux Mint 14....Haven't had any issues with the previous versions...The quality of capture and the list of options is awesome.
guvcview~~~1359539849~~~3dBloke~~~5~~~At last, I have found something that actually allows reliable webcam video capture and has a range of meaningful settings. Works well with my Logitech Pro 9000 webcam. There is a little delay / slow frame rate, but acceptable.
guvcview~~~1360104243~~~thebookkeeper~~~5~~~Nice, better than cheese, works well in Mint13Xfce with my MicrosoftVX700webcam (picture-rgb3-jpg/video-mpeg1-avi).
guvcview~~~1363366905~~~resilvajr~~~5~~~tried this with several cams w/o any issues; super easy to install and get working
guvcview~~~1367064815~~~purplewelshy~~~5~~~Does what it says on the tin, just remember that when you stop recording it autosaves the file to where you set it to. You don't press save.
guvcview~~~1368902983~~~mbott1982~~~5~~~Great!
guvcview~~~1369415916~~~jimice~~~5~~~Rychlejší a lepší než cheese
guvcview~~~1370021947~~~LohRampi~~~5~~~Um dos melhores programas de webcam que já usei!
guvcview~~~1383838966~~~MasterSlave~~~5~~~Very easy to use program
guvcview~~~1384787797~~~Osirez~~~5~~~Best webcam app on Linux with the most options.
guvcview~~~1385477532~~~joe94p~~~5~~~amazing program....works fine..
guvcview~~~1399905279~~~ReplicateThis~~~5~~~Was using Cheese hapily, and then it strted to freeze for video capture. This works much better for simple webcam video capture.
guvcview~~~1404059918~~~anandrkris~~~4~~~Works like a charm..
guvcview~~~1410169365~~~CarlPH~~~5~~~Does the job, tried taking photos with it
guvcview~~~1410327942~~~tuprofe_demusica~~~5~~~Excelente programa, muy buena interfaz gráfica permite todas las configuraciones de audio y video. Captura fotos, video y audio sin problemas.
guvcview~~~1412061169~~~ttjimera~~~3~~~In video mirror mode the image keeps flicking back to non-mirror image.
guvcview~~~1412064148~~~jahid_0903014~~~4~~~useful
guvcview~~~1427461995~~~lunybear79999~~~3~~~Nice program. I need to restart the program at first use for it to functioning. idk but fps is too low

gweled~~~1293748637~~~RobinJ~~~3~~~It's good... but I'd rather just run Bejeweled Deluxe 2 with Wine.
gweled~~~1295033728~~~abrius~~~5~~~Simple, perfect game. Good job.
gweled~~~1296711798~~~Boringbytes~~~3~~~the jewel images are nice, and the game is ok. The game could be improved with the addtions of sound effects,  recognizable levels, and a nice player reward/incentive, like an interesting animation that plays on successful level completion.

gweled~~~1316935119~~~wmilewski~~~5~~~My favourite game!
gweled~~~1316992758~~~Anleoje~~~4~~~I'ts a funny game, but it's very short :(
gweled~~~1322204173~~~magicbus~~~5~~~Great. Found it a lot easier than wining Bejewled 3, but it's lacking in features in comparison (more like the first Bejewled). I'd love to see a Gweled 2 or 3.
gweled~~~1332197313~~~quake0~~~5~~~Great Game!
gweled~~~1336188017~~~immortel~~~4~~~I like it but the graphics would need a little refresh.

gweled~~~1372173921~~~Ichag~~~4~~~ganz gut
gweled~~~1378795320~~~squirrelhavoc~~~4~~~Good, fun game. Only real drawback that bugs me is you can't click-hold a gem and move your mouse to another. You just click, then move, then click again. Not a big deal, but I am so used to doing it the other way, it get's annoying. Still fun though.
gweled~~~1378799526~~~Guyfriday~~~3~~~No sound.. Not fun without sound.

gweled~~~1409271815~~~markpatty~~~5~~~Great little waste of time..LOL

gwenview~~~1287558348~~~riki~~~5~~~Simple and one of the very best.
gwenview~~~1292977634~~~Rafson~~~5~~~love it, this viewer is a 'must have' for every KDE user
gwenview~~~1293535848~~~dhoca73~~~4~~~I miss AcdSee and this program remember a little to it. Is the only one I found that fit well the image to full screen
gwenview~~~1295140236~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good & can directly play movies
gwenview~~~1307392969~~~Germmare~~~5~~~Rating=1 Top Software, my opinion
gwenview~~~1304220552~~~heissfuss~~~5~~~Great for viewing images
gwenview~~~1308778155~~~Kuchum~~~5~~~Удобная вещь
gwenview~~~1317925754~~~legend~~~5~~~Simple and useful for basic things.
gwenview~~~1319482664~~~nicabod~~~5~~~Have used it extensively; like it a lot. Newer version can't edit free-form EXIF comments
gwenview~~~1324605915~~~LandisTwo~~~5~~~wish the maintainers would have kept the zoom incrament of 2.3.2
gwenview~~~1334462758~~~stel~~~5~~~Since KDE 4.8 was released,  it is probably the best image viewer oute there.
gwenview~~~1339885076~~~leo__sg1~~~5~~~Muy bueno. Un elegante visor de fotos y videos. Excelente si tenes una colección digna de mostrar.
gwenview~~~1354230334~~~prefersummer2~~~5~~~After years on Windows, I missed ACDsee, but this is the closest I've found. Use KIPI plugins with this. (does not replace the fantastic windows IRFANVIEW though, but fortunately that runs OK on WINE.
gwenview~~~1421780147~~~michelsaey~~~4~~~Best program to view your pictures & video's
gwenview~~~1357189587~~~zangpo~~~5~~~быстрая
gwenview~~~1359219215~~~shelff~~~5~~~ok
gwenview~~~1360684357~~~akb1~~~5~~~excelent
gwenview~~~1365645708~~~ilavtsevich~~~5~~~The best viewer interface.
gwenview~~~1373785981~~~thane~~~2~~~Poor default option for an image viewer/editor. No RAW support and editing options are not well implemented. Using gThumb with dcraw installed instead.
gwenview~~~1383049233~~~Korpu~~~4~~~Good thumbnail corter, allows rename and delete files from thumbnails view. Better thumbnail view interface than DigiKam. Difficult to enter to Browse thumbnails mode (grayed in start window). Have to open first any image through text menu on the right (why not on the left?) first, then thumbnails view becomes available. Very poor Configure GwenView options, you can't deactivate start window and Kipi Plugins. Once you find your way to Thumbnails view, it works really well and in most convenient way.
gwenview~~~1381857536~~~rildolho~~~4~~~Muito bom, pois dá pra fazer algumas edições nas imagens
gwenview~~~1383160756~~~Gerard-P~~~5~~~This program is absolutely great

gwenview~~~1396796049~~~albion66~~~5~~~Perfektní a jednoduché. The Best.
gwenview~~~1398241250~~~wBudge~~~3~~~A pretty slick app sadly tarnished by bugs (Mint KDE Petra). Beware as it sometimes shows images incorrectly (compared to other apps) such as too dark/red etc; also fatally crashes persisting until a reboot! GThumb currently suffices nicely.
gwenview~~~1419725946~~~JCH2~~~5~~~[NOTE: Use Synaptic to install and get all of the parts that are missing in this repository!]  Exceptional for those who prefer their own way of organizing images and don't want their preferences overridden by YDNTK automation. It has almost never crashed and had replace all other graphics preview, browse, and organization software in my system. Its adjust capabilites could use just a touch more work, but it is sound enough for most uses.
gwenview~~~1411546005~~~Jaxvanjuten~~~5~~~It handles icc profiles! I am using it in Mint Mate instead of gThumb because this one doesn't read icc embedded profiles
gwenview~~~1413471435~~~xfirebg~~~5~~~I like very much the full screen browsing of images. Better than the Windows default program.
gwenview~~~1419056939~~~wmh76wh~~~5~~~The best! Easier to crop selected part of multiple files. TQ to those involves in this software
gwenview~~~1420069373~~~poet~~~5~~~Great to vieuw photos !

gwhere~~~1295035344~~~Qruqs~~~2~~~It works, but has some very annoying behaviours, like it doesn't understand when the CD/DVD is changed, unless you restart the program, when searching you cannot with ease go to the found item, etc. Seems it's isn't finished. Too bad, has potential.
gwhere~~~1304178071~~~B_Tide~~~5~~~il miglio programma che abbia utilizzato per catalogare supporti rimovibili, peccato che richieda risorse estreme!
gwhere~~~1351923920~~~cirx~~~2~~~"intuitive interface" is sheer nonsense. You'd have to figure out via google how to operate the thing. Those who did didn't appear impressed either.
gwhere~~~1399191741~~~raksimihaly~~~4~~~egész jó, sajnos a inkább optikai lemezek, nem változó médiákra használható. Merevlemezre próbáltam, hiányolom a frissítés funkciót!
gwibber~~~1273153048~~~nilsgeylen~~~3~~~As far as Linux Twitter clients go, it's ok and it has certainly improved. Pino seems to be a big new competitor though, but I still prefer Tweetdeck with Air for now
gwibber~~~1273307377~~~Xtigyro~~~3~~~good app
gwibber~~~1273599862~~~Rich_Roast~~~4~~~Coupl'a nags but overall useful
gwibber~~~1274450476~~~isbura~~~3~~~Another below-average Twitter client for Linux. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. When it does work it has enough annoying bugs to make you wish it hadn't.
gwibber~~~1274648668~~~majortws~~~2~~~Good concept. Not great to use..
gwibber~~~1274904919~~~darkpegasus333~~~3~~~It's got decent protocol support, but it's not all that great to use.
gwibber~~~1275309217~~~RandyNose~~~2~~~Gwibber Has a nice look and feel. And then when you try to create a status update... The Keyboard response slows down to a crawl. - I can't use it, maybe others won't have this issue.
gwibber~~~1275506932~~~changke~~~3~~~slow, but not bad, a native gtk client is always better than those using adobe air
gwibber~~~1275693906~~~vorizod~~~3~~~Not an ideal, but when haven't better - we can use it. Wanna Tweetie for Linux ;-P
gwibber~~~1275926337~~~funker2010~~~3~~~upgradeable, but the concept is OK
gwibber~~~1275967207~~~Spike941~~~5~~~Works great for me.
gwibber~~~1276459415~~~thebrix~~~3~~~Good API support, but UI wastes a lot of space
gwibber~~~1278606703~~~chernobit~~~2~~~Slow and takes too many resources. With constant freezes.
gwibber~~~1279138875~~~sploopidy~~~1~~~Takes up lots of resources, confusing UI, and limited features. I'd rather use Internet Explorer to connect to facebook and twitter.
gwibber~~~1279549680~~~masoko~~~1~~~Useless
gwibber~~~1280629867~~~timloyal~~~5~~~It works for me I just like to get on and say something and get off. Great for that.
gwibber~~~1280525123~~~andriyr~~~2~~~useless
gwibber~~~1280716500~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Useless.
gwibber~~~1281259509~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~2~~~Very buggy software - continually fails to add Facebook despite successful authentication.
gwibber~~~1282020937~~~robertofmj~~~1~~~Horrible, confuse, many libs and "memory ram killer". I prefer qwit client.
gwibber~~~1282031476~~~mikefreeman~~~3~~~Ok, but could be better.
gwibber~~~1291513261~~~Xyie~~~3~~~Nice for reading updates, but I can't get it to send updates.
gwibber~~~1284409674~~~shwany~~~1~~~so and so.
gwibber~~~1286895987~~~iranquintero~~~1~~~No sirve Turpial es mejor
gwibber~~~1286901386~~~arztriper~~~2~~~Los hay mucho mejores.
gwibber~~~1288101194~~~Deadite81~~~2~~~This app almost correctly for me consistenty.
gwibber~~~1288279972~~~30ctsparer~~~1~~~Can't see any use or point
gwibber~~~1288601439~~~gandalf88bis~~~2~~~i think pidgin is better
gwibber~~~1288604806~~~kip-~~~1~~~useless.. i tried but after couple dont see the point specialy when refresh doesnt work correctly plus my updates doesnt appear on facebook.. i just uninstall.. its buggy.
gwibber~~~1288606023~~~punkrtekk~~~1~~~It is either too slow or it does not work at all, contains loads of bugs. Interface is not nice, either. Just a crap app.
gwibber~~~1288636081~~~frankeinstein~~~1~~~Very poor. Any alternative is a better alternative.
gwibber~~~1288899788~~~kad3t~~~2~~~Pidgin looks better, works better and... Wait for it... IS better! ^_^
gwibber~~~1289669273~~~pasdechance~~~1~~~works. doesn't work. works. doesn't work. hotot is a better twitter client and facebook is for suckers anyways
gwibber~~~1289962676~~~H4x0r18~~~2~~~Tried it, its works nice and all, but I don't need it. My Pidgin does everything for me. Thanks though.
gwibber~~~1290115716~~~angelhjose~~~2~~~No parece muy útil
gwibber~~~1290173853~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~gwibber has nothing to do with pidgin! It is for microblogging (like Twitter), not for chat!... And that works good for that.
gwibber~~~1290442140~~~Theologian~~~1~~~More standard junk to remove after a fresh install/upgrade
gwibber~~~1290647666~~~squirrel-the-tire~~~2~~~Pretty pointless in my opinion.
gwibber~~~1291045942~~~Koffeehaus~~~4~~~The idea behind it is very good, and would be usefull. But the app is really heavy. Are there any alternatives?
gwibber~~~1291125980~~~KazuSpara~~~1~~~Think uninstalling of Gwibber is a little tax for using Mint.
gwibber~~~1291130275~~~wanda~~~1~~~Es lebe Pidgin ,gwibber wirt deinstalliert auf mein rechner.
gwibber~~~1291163763~~~Demiahn~~~1~~~totally useless
gwibber~~~1291455223~~~yagolf~~~2~~~completely useless for me. in my opinion this app would only be useful on smartphones.
gwibber~~~1291652518~~~bikerboi87~~~2~~~some people just don't like social networking
gwibber~~~1291702625~~~dagon~~~1~~~Too unreliable and utterly pointless.
gwibber~~~1291736869~~~adzik~~~1~~~Connects, doesn't connect (to any social network). Lacking, and no real purpose as a social app.
gwibber~~~1291898754~~~sarhan~~~1~~~useless! sry for developers :/
gwibber~~~1291926046~~~Twiguard~~~4~~~It's good to stay informed by Twitter.
gwibber~~~1449020313~~~kneekoo~~~2~~~I'm not sure this should be included by default in Linux Mint but it sure looks like many people feel it's useless. It is the same to me. I'll uninstall it right after I send my review.
gwibber~~~1292669718~~~criss84~~~1~~~unninstal this sh.t
gwibber~~~1293031863~~~joeplugg~~~4~~~Works well for me; casual checking of twitter and facbook.

gwibber~~~1294175855~~~guv999~~~2~~~Not very elegant.  Much easier to have launchers om your desktop or browser etc
gwibber~~~1294326260~~~lalalee~~~1~~~I can never get this app to work.
gwibber~~~1294326702~~~terix~~~1~~~I delete it immediately after the distribution
gwibber~~~1295098341~~~jhrdka~~~1~~~Waste of RAM...
gwibber~~~1295876779~~~akash211~~~1~~~It should not be present by default
gwibber~~~1296347414~~~edilsoncr~~~1~~~I like social media, but Gwibber is a bad client. You have a low number of preferences to set, no tray icon and development way too focused on Ubuntu.
gwibber~~~1296623357~~~aptidude~~~1~~~Extremely unreliable
gwibber~~~1296696403~~~Samc~~~2~~~Took a lot to make it work. Perhaps best to wait until it matures a bit

gwibber~~~1302189739~~~nerjamartin~~~2~~~Must improve... a lot (minimize to tray bar doesn't work)

gwibber~~~1306220198~~~fothergillr~~~3~~~Clunky, stubborn and messy: Does the job, but at the cost of your patience.
gwibber~~~1307087360~~~magicbus~~~2~~~Had serious problems setting it up. It gave me lots of errors. Ended up dumping Facebook, so now I use Hotot.
gwibber~~~1307088423~~~CBindahouse~~~4~~~I use it, it seems fine for updating Twitter. It doesn't do realtime updating though :(
gwibber~~~1307847612~~~dumsterdave~~~3~~~ehh, nothing special.. gives me errors a lot when i try to use it
gwibber~~~1308371844~~~mitanshugamer~~~2~~~really not a fan..

gwibber~~~1310130991~~~rocker~~~1~~~error :-@
gwibber~~~1310132047~~~SeventhReign~~~2~~~Does what it claims .. sometimes.  Not sure if its the worst client available, but its close too it.
gwibber~~~1311752520~~~numn~~~5~~~Once you get the hang of it its a really nice tool. Its simple, quick,  it supports other socialmedia sites, desktopnotifications when you get new messages, crossplattform communication... it has everything i expect of a client!
gwibber~~~1312333460~~~blueXrider~~~2~~~Junk
gwibber~~~1312631452~~~marksuci~~~1~~~Katastrofa
gwibber~~~1314713176~~~anonymous_object~~~1~~~Pretty terrible as a Twitter client. Too few config options, takes up too much desktop space, and themes are weak. Also, fastest refresh time is 5 minutes...

gwibber~~~1327956180~~~c0nf~~~1~~~100% cpu
gwibber~~~1323574382~~~Jdogzz~~~3~~~I use it because it's the only social networking client with both Facebook and twitter. It works okay, but it could do a lot better. Glitchy at first run but hit refresh a few times, maybe reboot, and it'll start working.
gwibber~~~1324422462~~~foxerdb~~~1~~~Not usefull for me, preffer Pidgin

handbrake-gtk~~~1329683291~~~sbrbot~~~5~~~Excellent MPEG4 (x264) coder frontend. Although AVI container is not among best ones and that it is not fully specified, it is very common container and Handbrake does not support it any more.
handbrake-gtk~~~1334462630~~~stel~~~5~~~Simply awesome!
handbrake-gtk~~~1338466718~~~Capo~~~5~~~Pefect! Very nice software.
handbrake-gtk~~~1338763113~~~newpaul~~~3~~~Not easily accessible to the average user (not in the software center). You have to do it old school: compiling it yourself & installing via terminal. Awfully unfriendly & boring installation method even if you just follow the instructions and succeed; this is well demonstrated by the warning on the wiki page: “Please don't ask for support on this process, and please refrain from asking for help using features or complaining about bugs in unreleased versions.” Other than that, it delivers (support for .avi is long gone; you get .mp4 & .mkv).
handbrake-gtk~~~1348322291~~~tpost001~~~5~~~Most Amazing.  Utilizes all 4 threads of my i5 for amazing throughput.  winFF only used one at a time.  Great compression.  A setting of Android Mid really squeezes a video down.  A 19 GB TV show in HD becomes 1 GB with still great quality on a 46" plazma HDTV.
handbrake-gtk~~~1350227256~~~BBistheKing~~~5~~~One of the best I have used
handbrake-gtk~~~1352901438~~~RytronII~~~5~~~HandBrake brings the video size down considerably whilst keeping the quality very high.
handbrake-gtk~~~1354246788~~~liphvf~~~5~~~the best! o melhor do gênero!
handbrake-gtk~~~1357395371~~~webreac~~~5~~~One of the first software I always install (after chrom, virtualbox and xbmc). To make it available in software center, the commands are sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases then sudo apt-get update
handbrake-gtk~~~1362846305~~~superfly1031~~~5~~~The Best DVD ripper there is, works 99.9% of the time, and fast with my Geforce 9600
handbrake-gtk~~~1360286941~~~akabanekuroido~~~4~~~With this program Anime lovers can convert there MKV video's into MP4 with subs burned in. Then with the use of FFMpeg convert them to Xvid AVI.  Fast and good conversion, unlike some other software.

handbrake-gtk~~~1377923804~~~cjrpackwood~~~5~~~A wonderful DVD ripper. The settings to allow the user to transcode/rip a video in almost any video size, quality or media player (iPod, Ipad, smartphone, etc). It can rip most DRM protected DVD's/Videos. Plus, it works hand in hand with VLC media player (see my VLC review). A must have if you work with videos in any form. I use it in LinuxMint 15 and Windows 7...so its also cross platform.
handbrake-gtk~~~1378626918~~~powerhouse~~~5~~~Excellent quality rips of DVDs and HD material, even when using the "normal" setting. Copes with copy protected DVDs - it worked with each and every DVD in my library. Includes the option to add or burn in subtitles, which I often use (I only watch movies with original soundtrack). I use it on Linux Mint 14 and 15.
handbrake-gtk~~~1381892243~~~Time~~~5~~~Love it, but I can't find it in LM15...

handbrake-gtk~~~1451638544~~~ocarnicer~~~1~~~Este programa (-GTK) no funciona con Linux Mint. Arranca y parece que funciona, pero no trabaja bien. te vuelve loco. mejor instálate la siguiente opción (la que no pone -GTK) que funciona muy bien y a la primera. Si aún así no os funciona bien, instaladlo a través de la terminal de la siguiente manera (4 líneas): $sudo apt-get purge handbrake # remove any old versions $sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-git-snapshots $sudo apt-get update$sudo apt-get install handbrake-gtk

hardinfo~~~1382550585~~~stevewood007~~~5~~~It would be great for this to be installed by default in LM15.   The built-in benchmarks are a simple way to gauge max CPU temperatures.  This was a default application prior to LM15, and I went looking for it right away.
hardinfo~~~1385377488~~~bambitheslug~~~5~~~This should absolutely be required as installed by default. I just upgraded from Mint 14 and I'm shocked to see that 15 and above don't include this. I tried another program, lshw-gtk, which is a frontend to a default package, but it didn't generate any results on my machine. This one works exactly how I remembered it and is crucial for system builders or anyone curious about what is recognized in their systems and which drivers are being loaded. I used to know how to get a lot of this information from the command line, but most of my work is not in Linux anymore so I don't remember how. The information from this program is a good starting point for diagnosing driver problems for those who don't want to dig through CLI output.

hostapd~~~1374917329~~~bilde2910~~~5~~~Works great, a lot of configuration options, and lets you create an almost-fully-working access point together with dhcp. Only problem I've found so far is that NAT seems to glitch out hostapd, maybe that is me doing something wrong. Great daemon!
hostapd~~~1411035882~~~jahid_0903014~~~4~~~The current veriosn is buggy, use <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wpa/hostapd_1.0-3ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb">this</a> instead

Everything is working well with my HP AIO Pro 8610. The problem is HPLIP Satus Service is not working at all even disapearing. On the same HP laptop, Ubuntu 14.04.x doesn't have this issue. Would be nice that Linux Mint developpers could fix it. Thanks.
hplip~~~1445697137~~~pollat~~~4~~~Had to install it from a site (thanks elstellino), because 17.2 bundled version did not work for my scanner. Now working ok, although shown as not installed in software manager.

htop~~~1431680702~~~mikaloyd~~~5~~~This is the undisputed champion of gui programs which try to show users every possible movement of data in their machines. If you need to "watch" a process for fun or repair htop can probably show it to you. Im certain the developers were far more concerned about the possibility of leaving a process unwatched than they ever were about watching too many. Which is good . If I had to point out something that was maybe not as great as the information htop gives then Id have to say it is the wild bright text on jet black background. Might look a little bit like Netscape Navigator having vivid Tripod dreams. That doesnt matter though. this program is complete and it works well. 5 stars baybee

httrack~~~1431093915~~~jahid_0903014~~~5~~~This is quite promising, but recently it failed to mirror a website. It was a php website though. The htmls it downloaded was all messed up and couldn't be run at localhost.

hugin~~~1424006993~~~francheu~~~5~~~Super logiciel pour faire des panoramas, facile à utiliser et donne de bons résultats
hugin~~~1420330753~~~fotonix~~~2~~~One of only options for Linux (my 2 paid-for Windoze ones beat it by a hundred miles). Overcluttered interface, no simple workflow or obvious control over options.  Last fight was 10 min and no result, PanoPro in Windows worked in 45 seconds. Hugin can do with some extreme UI streamlining, also its is slow-as heck.
hugin~~~1364893637~~~suaefar~~~5~~~Top
hugin~~~1387492786~~~johnwhiatt~~~4~~~Just upgraded to 2013.0.0.4... on Linux Mint 14 Nadia Cinnamon 64-bit. Seems to be working. Has anyone else upgraded with success. What needs to be done to update software repository?

i3~~~1393791805~~~witt0191~~~3~~~When I used this package it did not install dmenu
i3~~~1438811120~~~doubledodge~~~3~~~Needs a tutorial - the metapackage DOES NOT install suckless-tools or i3status, you must install this separately and edit the config file to use i3-dmenu-desktop (not dmenu-run).  Also its best to use the windows key instead of Alt for $mod so Alt is free to access menus in launched window style applications, e.g. FIrefox.  Otherwise this is a potentially useful alternative to the usual Mint window managers and promises to be particularly attractive to the mouse averse like me.
i3~~~1451368066~~~acornblue~~~4~~~i3lock (>= 2.2), suTrying out i3. Does seem a lot faster than mate. Note: by default apt does not install recommended packages (i3lock (>= 2.2), suckless-tools, i3status (>= 2.3), dunst)

i3-wm~~~1424145759~~~pmandic~~~5~~~Much better than awesome wm imho and more flexible for multiple monitors (aside that it doesn't support compositing well).
i3-wm~~~1433191100~~~goetzkluge~~~5~~~Great wm. 1st I configured mate, especially ibus (German, English, Chinese, Japanese). Then I installed I3 using "sudo apt-get install i3 i3status dbus suckless-tools xfce4-appfinder". After logout and then login with I3, the input method selection button shows up in the bottom bar. --- I moved ~/.i3/config to ~/.config/i3/config --- Caja should be called with "caja --no-desktop".
i3-wm~~~1439076321~~~krause~~~5~~~Great wm!

i8kutils~~~1358040037~~~camypaj~~~4~~~package requires tk8.5 for starting i8kmon utility, instead of tk8.4
i8kutils~~~1439648010~~~sunil-mahajan~~~4~~~Thank so much for this utility- my dell inspirion laptop fan just stopped making noise  while I use Linux Mint. I could have stopped using Linux without this fix. Thank you developer. Hope this is correct fix.

iagno~~~1422017452~~~mintberrycrunch82~~~1~~~It would be a fun game, but it keeps freezing on me. Uses up to 30% of my processor speed at random times and stalls every few minutes
iagno~~~1432662396~~~erfan8000~~~3~~~**
iagno~~~1437973989~~~Phobos22~~~2~~~I would love this game except whenever I am take control of the board and the computer is bound to lose the program simple freezes up. So there is no way to win.

ibam~~~1316348392~~~townie3057~~~4~~~Agree with shwany - have to type IBAM at the command line.  Though it gives an accurate reading is and is very useful!
ibus~~~1303163993~~~roguededguy~~~4~~~It's getting to be better than scim functionally for me. It definitely beats scim in the elegant and simple department.

ibus~~~1410530085~~~johnniedoo~~~3~~~I installed this unknowingly, probably along with font packages, I dont have any real need for it, as i understand it. I can see how beneficial it can be, however, to many people. I have qiana and this ibus version is extremely easy to use, configure. I tried it and if i only could type in those other languages...

icewm~~~1270926031~~~Roin~~~5~~~Fast and simple Windows Manager, I just love it!
icewm~~~1280491478~~~elscripto~~~4~~~One of the best window managers around - simple, blazing fast and easily configurable by text files. If you need to fit your GUI within 40 MB of used memory, then IceWm is the best choice directly on top of the X server. In combination with pure LXDE you may fit within 100 MB of used memory. However medium to advanced linux experience is needed to set it up and running properly.
icewm~~~1284953329~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Light and quick for a desktop/window manager, but be sure you're not afraid of tinkering with config files to customize it your way. Easy enough to figure out for an intermediate user. Adventurous beginners only.

icewm~~~1318549933~~~mintlinux~~~2~~~Text is way too small, menu crashes too.

id3ren~~~1283553642~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~5~~~Great tool for batch renaming MP3s in the Terminal.  Syntax takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's a very handy and effective tool.
id3v2~~~1283553139~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~5~~~Great, lightweight and simple tool for editing ID3v2 tags.

idle-python2.6~~~1288441282~~~ItDontMeanAThing~~~3~~~Easy to use because it doesn't do much.  Sometimes doesn't recognize code changes.  Work around is to delete .pyc files.  When that fails, exit and restart IDLE.

ike-qtgui~~~1292245332~~~richardstreet~~~5~~~This is a brilliant cross-platform GUI tool for connecting to the firewall's IPSec VPNs and appliances. No need to get tied up in configuring racoon, ipsec tools and so on - just type in the values in the appropriate places and click connect. Works like a charm. You can easily export working policies to distribute around others using this client through Linux/Windows/Mac/BSD versions of the product.

Impossible to use.

imagemagick~~~1400531120~~~juandiego~~~2~~~La GUI o interfaz gráfica es mala, mal manejo y poco intuitivo. No traducido al español.
imagemagick~~~1402499385~~~topper~~~4~~~Aunque la interfaz gráfica sea poco atractiva, las virtudes de Imagemagick están en el uso que puedes hacer de él desde la consola: conversión de tipos de archivos de imágenes, generación de miniaturas, escalados, añadir texto, generar gifs animados, entre otras cosas. Todo ello con comandos como convert, animate, mogrify, etc. Vale la pena.
imagemagick~~~1414652740~~~Musickiller~~~1~~~GUI just sucks. just worst possible for such an application.

imagemagick~~~1436907505~~~Huskell~~~1~~~This is so bad, also why the hell, if I remove it, it will remove Play on Linux and Calibre??? No sense.
imagemagick~~~1442952626~~~rudspring~~~5~~~The perfect tool for all my image processing jobs. The best feature is to batch process numerical data to graphics and plots!

imagemagick~~~1445893239~~~harrygrey~~~1~~~Das ist das Schlechteste, was es wohl im Bereich Grafik gibt: Animierte Gifs z.B. funktionieren gar nicht. Die Handhabung ist ebenfalls haarsträubend. Deinstallation geht nicht, weil dann auch PlayonLinux wegfällt. Wahrscheinlich sind die Macken die PlayonLinux hat auch auf dieser Basis.

imagination~~~1453486119~~~Maple~~~5~~~Works fine in mint 17.2. "sudo apt-get install libav-tools" will fix export error with missing avconv. Also, may need libsox installed to import your audio file format  (just use find :)). Exported slideshow with audio successfully. Good program, simple, gets job done and no bloat :).
imagination~~~1454888565~~~buzby~~~5~~~Quick and simple to use. To get the export option to work in Mint 17.2 I had to install libav-tools, also installed libavcodec-extra, from the repository.

inkscape~~~1271356768~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Vor 15 Jahren hätte man wohl Corel Draw benutzt ... für viel Geld. Aber heute ist es so viel einfacher. Inskcape ist kostenlos und ein exzellentes Programm für all jene Menschen, die Corel, MicroGrafix oder ähnliches gewohnt sind.Vektorzeichnen at it's best.
inkscape~~~1273153237~~~nilsgeylen~~~5~~~It's not part of a big suite like Illustrator is so it cannot be compared in that way. As a standalone vector app it rocks and removes the need for any paid (and overpriced) commercial alternative

A huge amount of knobs on the rigth side and all of the those have equal amount of graphic value ?! Please take a look in to Androin apps.... simpel ,beutiful and works. So why Mint or Ubuntu cant have same thing like that ?
jabref~~~1281774373~~~NfG84~~~4~~~Comfortable tool to keep all the papers ordered. It has a online search for article, but many journals are not supported.
jabref~~~1286101777~~~alaak~~~4~~~Unfortunately you need to enter most data by hand. This gives good control on small bibliographys but is tedious if you have many references. In the second case I prefer Mendeley Desktop available as *.deb package as well.
jabref~~~1290305074~~~FunkyWhale~~~4~~~I tried many, this beats all. Very consistent. Lives well with your hand-generated bib files as well.
jabref~~~1318630573~~~xalbert76~~~5~~~I have over 2500 references in my bibliography and JabRef handles them with ease. This is one of the most useful softwares I have used when writing papers.
jabref~~~1351783193~~~fafnir~~~5~~~A friend of mine, who wrote his thesis (of about 1, 40,000 words), suggested this to me. I've been using the Windows version for over 2 years, and found little reasons to complain. I store around 6000 citations, along with annotations and links wherever possible to pdfs on my machine. The manual input method is actually a boon: it helps you identify and correct errors unlike automated fetches from Google Scholar and other sources when using software like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote. Also Zotero crashes often; Mendeley pretends to be free (asking you to upgrade after a point), and EndNote is... well, it sucks. JabRef is consistent, the easiest to understand, and the most reliable bibliography citation manager. Much thanks to the developers!
jabref~~~1371664296~~~lordamit~~~5~~~Love this reference manager.

jedit~~~1451542875~~~kulvikram~~~5~~~macro support is very useful
jeex~~~1292535715~~~dagon~~~2~~~This is a clean, non-buggy hex editor. In my opinion it has a couple of big drawbacks. 1: I expect to find a row to the left indicating where in the file I am... not implemented. 2: Even though you can examine the output in different formats such as ascii... for some reason it isn't presented with the hexcode but opens up in a separate window. I usually wan't the two to be correlated.

Version 2.6.5390 provides legal assistance to write for many languages ​​including French, German, Spanish ... it's operating with my jabber /xmpp account (from pidgin)
jitsi~~~1417211893~~~squid-f~~~4~~~2.5 works better (to be downloaded from jitsi.org) ; actually I have never succeeded to connect to my XMPP jisti account with the 2.4 but it worked straight away with the 2.5 ! Skype user interface is still more friendly than Jitsi one. The day Jitsi becomes truly multi-platform (including tablets), it will be a better option than Skype.

joe~~~1351354483~~~ali20~~~3~~~small command line editor
joe~~~1417814333~~~3gghead~~~5~~~If there is a better cli text editor, it'd have to offer a 'Joe-mode' since the key commands are too familiar. It's not something that can be solved with an alias (like  'ls' in a DOS env).
joe~~~1392912424~~~Surocap~~~3~~~I prefer VI
joe~~~1418118999~~~unixpro~~~5~~~Best cli for 10+ years. Wordstar key-mappings, syntax highlighting, per file type preferences, auto-indent, macro recording, block editing, searching, copying, bookmarks, spell checker, shell exit, split windows, regex pattern matching, hex and decimal display. If you want more then you're simply greedy!

jwm~~~1284953584~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Very nice for a lightweight desktop that uses minimal resources and is lightning fast, but beginner users beware! This takes some knowledge to set it up properly and make it look polished. There is much config file editing ahead if you wish to make it pretty. Recommended for intermediate to advanced users.

k3b~~~1376000739~~~n5pci2~~~5~~~burns my BD-R disks...
k3b~~~1376430203~~~kondor~~~5~~~Ez bizony működik!
k3b~~~1378700673~~~kyouzins~~~1~~~As expected for default/installed software of any distro it must working without any setup made. It took two of my DL dvd and I still don't know the problem, every problem has settings and after doing it new problem arises. If the software is not usuable you need some settings to make it work then it losed already its purpose. Hope they or Linux distro will make it work no settings needed, just after OS installation if there are bundled software there it MUST be working already.
k3b~~~1378791072~~~ozzfan1976~~~5~~~Great software!
k3b~~~1379708711~~~lochoa~~~5~~~A very complete app!
k3b~~~1380205006~~~anhaedre~~~5~~~très bon logiciel de gravure, je ne suis pas fan de l'interface par contre. very good.
k3b~~~1380652936~~~Pawli~~~5~~~Je to Super
k3b~~~1380832643~~~Pollywog~~~5~~~Much preferred to alternate cd/dvd buring apps!
k3b~~~1380973010~~~olegrumpy~~~5~~~I'll tell ya...I'm not a big fan of kde (no offense intended) but this piece of software is without a doubt, a real keeper.  I've installed it more times than I can count on numerous Debian based distros, and it has never, ever been less than stupendous.  Once installed it's simple to use with a minimal learning curve, and has always delivered outstanding results (unless the problem is the idiot doing the input, namely me).  It is one of the first programs I add to any new installation.
k3b~~~1405872064~~~visterine~~~5~~~o melhor
k3b~~~1381960496~~~observer7~~~5~~~mature program and feature rich  on any cd/dvd project you can think of
k3b~~~1381977210~~~nessor~~~5~~~Great program!
k3b~~~1382081241~~~bandelguy~~~5~~~Should be ported to cinnamon / gnome
k3b~~~1382142964~~~scearley~~~1~~~Never could get k3b to work. filed reports, nobody had help. K3B would read a blank disc when placed in the drive. When I tried to write, the resulting dialog the disc, despite it being displayed in the main K3B window. Won't even work for formatting/erasing discs. Extra aggravating since nobody would offer any help beyond 'i dunno' - linux community is usually much better than that.
k3b~~~1382500689~~~tenpennys~~~5~~~I don't understand why this isn't the default burner for all mint and ubuntu installs
k3b~~~1383144346~~~linesma~~~5~~~This program is my goto program for all my burning needs. Should definitely be ported to Cinnamon.
k3b~~~1383694949~~~silicont~~~5~~~Best burner yet.  Does all the basics flawlessly, and it's interface is like the old burners I grew up on.
k3b~~~1384960804~~~Vector-full~~~5~~~Excelente recomendado 100%
k3b~~~1384911614~~~gtaero~~~4~~~It's a great burner/ripper data wise, but there isn't a bootable disc option for ISO's, so it's OK.
k3b~~~1384925937~~~gingerichkr~~~3~~~OK with most tasks, but wasted a couple DL-DVD's trying to burn ISO's... Beware!

k3b~~~1394052816~~~skywolfblue~~~5~~~A very powerful CD/DVD burning app, I've burned many DVDs with it without issue.
k3b~~~1394713289~~~mazinga~~~5~~~Brasero can hide itself.
k3b~~~1394978166~~~josilinux~~~5~~~Usei o Nero por muito tempo, depois que conheci o LInux, o K3b impressionou, nem o Brasero é tão comleto assim!
k3b~~~1397982081~~~zl1bjq~~~2~~~I was just beginning to like Linux too. Well all those fans out there must be clever. I believe this sort of software is an excellent example of what keeps people off Linux. I have spen 2hrs trying to burn a DVD and no sense from it at all. It is not user friendly. I will have to revert to windows/Nero for this job.
k3b~~~1398521967~~~Grimalkin~~~5~~~My favourite Disc Burning program

k3b~~~1401031165~~~fid_def~~~5~~~Perfect for intelligent users, others can use Brasero.
k3b~~~1401126728~~~chthonic~~~2~~~great - if you have all day and a half to rip or burn ONE dvd - and with current disk protection it won
k3b~~~1402694067~~~1hotjob~~~4~~~Just started using this. I found it doesn't support MP3 files. I did some research and found you need to run this command in a terminal window. sudo apt-get install libk3b6-extracodecs  - That solved my problems.
k3b~~~1402859816~~~niccos~~~4~~~Its really smooth
k3b~~~1404994886~~~Banzai_Beagle~~~1~~~Burns one DVD then crashes and causes all other burners to crash as well.  Piece of junk.

kazam~~~1421777140~~~ReplicateThis~~~2~~~Works OK for simple screencasts, but just made a slideshow of a Minecraft tutorial. RecordMyDesktop may have audio trouble, but at least it made a moving picture rather than Kazam's slideshow.
kazam~~~1424324559~~~carlosmtnz~~~3~~~Lo he usado poco hasta el momento, pero parece funcionar bien en proyectos de poca duración. I haven't fully tested it, but it seems to work fine in short projects.

kazam~~~1437300589~~~RC404~~~3~~~Great design, but odd functionality. Even when set to 60 fps, the framerate of the video is very, very low. Audio recording goes well, but I would still stick with OBS for better results.

kblackbox~~~1396579666~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~The challenge to solve this puzzle is just awesome, and yet the game is quite as simple! The step by step tutorial and the difficulty customization are outstanding ideas. Only if there could be some different themes (or capability to choose backgrounds), then this will be perfect.
kbounce~~~1275158265~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~It's just like the Jezzball game for windows back in the 1990s.

kde-config-grub2~~~1431665039~~~mikaloyd~~~5~~~Now that UEFI is common and getting commoner my old buddy bootrepair  has as great a chance to do further harm to a broken grub 2 installation. A graphical way to edit carefully was needed. A way that allowed people who arent keyboaed wizards of the terminals to at least see what grub2 is doing and changes that can be made. The only bit of this that needs help is the very old versionin repositories. The newer version, by some years, fixes a bug or two but ostly it allows you to finally get rid of all those deadweight listings of kernals listed in your bios from your computer's distant past

kdenlive~~~1271330059~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~Best video editor I have used on linux. Can import multiple formats and render/export to a huge variety with control over size and quality. Learning curve is a bit steep but there are good tutorials on the website. All I need is more time...
kdenlive~~~1273776500~~~zole052~~~5~~~Awesome video editor for linux! Get it.
kdenlive~~~1274536669~~~DanRock007~~~4~~~Good video editor still has some bugs

kdenlive~~~1296941337~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~This program works fantastic! I am able to do all the fancy editing I would like to do. The only downturn is that I keep getting an error that my home file is not accessible. Other than that its a complete thumbs up!
kdenlive~~~1301144934~~~jasonjohnwells~~~4~~~save often
kdenlive~~~1301855009~~~bentinc~~~5~~~Has some instablity issues (getting better). Anyway, the best video editor for Linux if you need more than PiTiVi has to offer. Does not need KDE to run, just some KDE-libraries but it  works with GNOME just as well!

kdenlive~~~1334734481~~~grtt~~~3~~~sdl mlt
kdenlive~~~1335468173~~~sapiensantiquus~~~4~~~My favorite video editor so far. Very intuitive interface. Simpler and better UI than other video editors, although lacking a bit in features.
kdenlive~~~1335714246~~~paulik~~~1~~~The dummest error message on Earth: "MLT's SDL module not found. Please check your MLT install. kdenlive will not work until this issue is fixed". What the *** is MLT? This is why free software is often garbage. How do you expect people to switch to your software when you expect everybody to be an expert beforehand? Wake up. User-friendliness is paramount, not secondary.
kdenlive~~~1352630783~~~scott65~~~3~~~Not that great, really stupid and awkward slow time consuming in some ways, but it gets the job done if you don't mind the frustration.

kdenlive~~~1379115058~~~Matt4179~~~5~~~When I first tried this on Ubuntu, it crashed often.  I found that if you got to there website and install their ppa, you get the updated version which they recommend and it works way better.
kdenlive~~~1383676906~~~davidswanson1~~~5~~~WOW! Amazing! So easy to use and make home movies.
kdenlive~~~1384893895~~~gamz~~~5~~~actuellement très complet
kdenlive~~~1386542275~~~mbott1982~~~5~~~I like it.
kdenlive~~~1391980505~~~woody709acy~~~5~~~I'm new to the OS, the methods of Linux, and video is not something done often. This program worked right from the start. Only drawback so far is the small number of supported formats. Perhaps a shortcoming on my machine.
kdenlive~~~1392806821~~~aldano~~~4~~~Not Bad .
kdenlive~~~1398308556~~~ferretwilliams~~~5~~~Does most things I want it to do and the videos never have trouble playing on other computers. Kdenlive is one of the reasons I switched to Linux. Every OS should come with a multi-track video editor.
kdenlive~~~1398903138~~~mikki68~~~4~~~it's very good
kdenlive~~~1400018096~~~lobozamora~~~5~~~Te sentias triste por no tener el Vegas o el Premiere? KdenLive es justo lo que necesitas para editar tus videos y mucho mas. gracias a su cantidad de opciones y filtros puesdes hacer desde composisiones con varios videos hasta el famoso CromaKey.
kdenlive~~~1400424233~~~stevenmint~~~5~~~Amazing free editor!

kdenlive~~~1434576486~~~asaoppenheimer~~~3~~~The best video editor!
kdenlive~~~1437590980~~~liam_e~~~1~~~Worthless. Closes when clicking save button. In the beginning there wasn't even a save us button - you have to add it from menu customizer by yourself. What kind of UX is that?! After saving the program just closes, not even an error message.
kdenlive~~~1438105620~~~guilleagudelo~~~5~~~sudo apt-get install kde-runtime & sudo apt-get install kde-workspace-data
kdenlive~~~1438693602~~~Wxnzxn~~~3~~~Good, but lets not kid ourselves - it doesn't hold up to the current generation of professional video editing software. In comparison to stuff like Vegas or Premiere Pro it feels uncomfortable to use and lacks features. For your average consumer video editing needs, it's decent and servicable, though.
kdenlive~~~1446161942~~~Rygardo~~~5~~~He probado otros editores y este me gusta mucho.
kdenlive~~~1448865164~~~qubodup~~~5~~~It seems like it's broken when installed the "normal" way ( https://youtu.be/gyxXQ4bBuag ) but there are solutions posted at https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=269&t=124095
kdenlive~~~1450210285~~~Hagbard99~~~5~~~The best Linux Video Editor

kdenlive~~~1453304924~~~AlainMint~~~4~~~Mas parou de funcionar e não consigo instalar mais
kdenlive~~~1452539371~~~melancoholic~~~1~~~It doesn't work on Mint 17.3. After runing application it crashes when I try to add clip, some menu items shows with caption
kdenlive~~~1453319008~~~trhe44~~~5~~~19 january 2016, the kdenlive (0.9.8) version of Linux Mint 17 don't install require dependency, but kdenlive is a very good Video editor. Please install the ppa:sunab/kdenlive-release version, to try potentiellaty of Kdenlive. Today is very difficult to use version Kdenlive from repositery Linux Mint 17, noicons, no menu, no translation, no import, no export, lot of crashs, but this aren't Kdenlive, this is a bad package from Linux Mint without automatic installation of dependencies. In french: 19 janvier 2016, à ce jour la version (0.9.8) de Kdenlive proposée par Linux Mint n'installe pas les dépendances requises, veuillez utiliser le ppa:sunab/kdenlive-release pour tester le potentiel de Kdenlive. Aujourd'hui la version utilisé par Linux Mint n'installe pas les dépendances automatiquement, il en résulte un kdenlive, sans icônes, avec de mauvais menus, sans traduction et des crashs obligatoires, mais ceci n'est pas Kdenlive, seulement un mauvais paquet de la part de Linux Mint (sauf à installer les dépendances manuellement.) Mais le plus simple est d'utiliser le ppa officiel, bonne découverte!
kdenlive~~~1453202662~~~wurm~~~4~~~Super, nur leider immer wieder Absturz - hoffe auf Weiterentwicklung
kdenlive~~~1455852992~~~Peferling~~~2~~~Current package is corrupt, missing dependencies.  Installed package from Authors site, everything is there, but still crashes/freezes.  I'm on a dual quad xeno.  Sorry, to do video, you gotta do windows.
kdenlive-data~~~1420591756~~~settara~~~5~~~good

kdesudo~~~1393769878~~~acoustionicus~~~2~~~Mint 16 KDE Edition - Attempting to run Update Manager.  KDESudo asks for my password.  Tells me if I get it wrong (deliberately, just testing!), but more than 90% of the time fails to start Update Manager when I get it right.  Eventually, after on average about 20 attempts, for no particular reason, it works.  You wouldn't want to be planning something time sensitive!
kdesudo~~~1409554662~~~jahid_0903014~~~5~~~Very useful, needed to run graphical applications as super user
kdesvn~~~1301127864~~~sheldonh~~~3~~~Could do with further intergration
kdesvn~~~1305208175~~~irishfury~~~4~~~Love it.  Almost as good os TortoiseSVN.  It's getting there.
kdesvn~~~1320670534~~~pixel293~~~3~~~I liked it better when I had a KDE environmetn setup.  Under GNOME it's okay, and seems to be better than the other GUIs.  My biggest problem with it lately is that functionality is hid under two different sub menus, and remembering which one is a pain.
kdesvn~~~1335377101~~~mikhailo~~~4~~~good, though could be better like tortoise
kdesvn~~~1383056494~~~dheeraj9823~~~5~~~Finally a svn ui without a flaw.

kdevelop~~~1363901197~~~pclausen~~~5~~~Best IDE
kdevelop~~~1379814290~~~marku~~~5~~~This is the only IDE﻿ I have ever found that can do this. I've been struggling to import a cmake project to Eclipse CDT (debugging is not working and spent a whole day trying to fix it), CodeBlocks (code completion SUCKS!) and Monodevelop can't import a cmake project. KDE is the best I have ever found.
kdevelop~~~1432912064~~~jahid_0903014~~~5~~~This is a very powerful all in one IDE
kdevelop~~~1443394896~~~lib2know~~~5~~~kdevelop is good and fat and, more interesting, is the ticket to the exciting world of kde community

kdiamond~~~1395962267~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~Great game. The "Egyptian" theme increases difficulty level since the diamonds shapes are identical. Sadly, I can't get access to get more themes, yet the gameplay is good.
kdiff3~~~1301074145~~~Piilen~~~5~~~Also works under gnome not just KDE
kdiff3~~~1301077570~~~wanda~~~3~~~there's also a stripped-down version called kdiff3-qt not depending on the kde libraries , better.
kdiff3~~~1386091659~~~mohammedmt~~~4~~~Like Kdiff

keepass2~~~1322761188~~~david56~~~4~~~Best cross-platform password manager I have found.
keepass2~~~1324516908~~~oe6tkt~~~5~~~My favourite password database and manager. It uses mono on my linux machine.
keepass2~~~1331616556~~~andi303~~~5~~~Best way to save your passwords!
keepass2~~~1333546671~~~bolek73~~~4~~~Im Prinzip nicht schlecht. Seit neustem geht die ctr+c und v nicht
keepass2~~~1339747462~~~cr8086~~~3~~~Chinese operating environment does not display text
keepass2~~~1343930037~~~himgil~~~5~~~Definitely better than KeepassX in many ways
keepass2~~~1347925911~~~pillus666~~~2~~~sometimes there is no text.... it's not reliable.
keepass2~~~1348430302~~~naguera~~~5~~~Simply needful!
keepass2~~~1348561239~~~x3ro~~~5~~~Using it on my Windows-PC for years now and finally on my Linux Mint Laptop :)
keepass2~~~1409400540~~~mintstar~~~5~~~Must have on any new install.
keepass2~~~1352727109~~~dwarburton~~~5~~~Easily the best password manager, but beware of copy/paste wierdness and the cursor being rendered in the wrong place in text boxes.  This is the fault of the Mono framework, not Keepass!
keepass2~~~1356122399~~~delfsegek~~~5~~~Had my database and keyfile from windows 7. Now a seamless turn to linux! All works well.
keepass2~~~1359804321~~~metamal~~~4~~~I use it because it's multiplatform. It works well, but GUI on Linux should be improved.
keepass2~~~1360428044~~~nzc3~~~5~~~One of the first programs to be installed. Multiplatform (iOS, Android, Windows and Linux). Just excellent.
keepass2~~~1361439163~~~vk5880~~~4~~~Despite some mono related bugs, it is really good one
keepass2~~~1361635474~~~sanrafael~~~4~~~I use it both in win and mint. IMO it's very good
keepass2~~~1363445151~~~green~~~5~~~I use it in both Windows and Mint, too. For paranoid cloud sync, put the keypass file inside an encrypted folder inside Dropbox. To create it in Windows, use Boxcryptor (free), on Mint, use Cryptkeeper. Works like a charm.
keepass2~~~1367761008~~~qc23qa~~~3~~~thiss usefull and poweful to db keepass, but this program is window appliction. not to linux! mono is many problem with liux!
keepass2~~~1372348814~~~handy~~~5~~~very useful for all my passwords and other secrets :-)
keepass2~~~1372754804~~~Frugivore~~~2~~~Would be good but far too many issues/bugs possibly due to its not being linux native or due to Mono. KeepassX for me is much better.
keepass2~~~1377390501~~~PatMan~~~5~~~Opens my .kbdx file from GDrive - KeePassX doesn't (Mint 15)
keepass2~~~1379755879~~~suicida~~~5~~~Opens my .kdbx file from Dropbox, all my passwords in one place. Great port.
keepass2~~~1380542716~~~Mathew-Moore~~~5~~~I use it on various platforms. Works Well
keepass2~~~1384028458~~~kaamos~~~3~~~Lots of interface glitches, not all the dropdowns working. It is clear that this was ported over from Windows. When typing not all the text is displayed, even though if you highlight it, it exists. Its is feature dense which I liked, however due to all the problems I have decided to give KeePassX a shot.
keepass2~~~1384715829~~~schiefa~~~5~~~Great crossplatform password manager

keepass2~~~1398527873~~~midtempo~~~2~~~It has interface glitches, especially when you minimize the window and later restore it.  When this problem happens, you can't see what you are doing anymore, and you have to close the program and restart it.  Otherwise it works great, and it's one of the few programs in Linux (the only one?) that supports KeePass 2 files.  But this glitch is inexcusable.

keepass2~~~1406246158~~~Ion_ore~~~5~~~KeePass2 is probably the most useful single piece of software I use daily. A few years ago I was using the same few passwords for every website I registered on, which is terribly insecure; if my password for one of the websites was ever revealed, the attacker could use that password to log in to many of my other accounts. The solutions for this would be using a complex password and using a different complex password for every website. However, having one complex password is difficult enough to remember, and having multiple complex ones would be impossible. So, what should I do, write my passwords down to a text file or a piece of paper? Obviously not, since if anyone ever stumbled across that particular file or notebook, the security of all my logins would be compromised. I'm a humanist, but I don't trust my fellow humans that much.  This is where KeePass2 comes in. With KeePass2, you create a database, encrypted with one master password, that holds all your logins. You enter details about your login to the database: a title for the entry (for example "Amazon.com"), your user name, you password, and the website's address. You can also add notes, which is useful when you need to have multiple email addresses for one account or set security questions. The database has multiple categories, which are "General", "Windows", "Internet", "eMail", and "Homebanking". You can create your own categories, so you aren't limited to only those mentioned. There is also a search feature, which is useful for those who don't want to categorise their logins or people who just have hundreds of passwords.  There is always a compromise between security and convenience. KeePass2, however, feels that choosing a balance between them should be in the user's hands. The most basic choice is the first one any KeePass2 user has to make, and that is choosing the method of securing your database. A KeePass2 database is encrypted with a master key, which is generated from a master password, a keyfile, or both of them. A master password is like a normal password but with the word "master" added to emphasize its importance. KeePass2 gives you an estimate of your master password's strength as you're entering it, a useful feature that helps you pick a secure password. The other part of the master key is a keyfile. If you choose to use a keyfile, you will be required to point KeePass2 to that exact file every time you open your database. Any file will do, the only requirement is that the file doesn't change. Using a keyfile increases security, but can also become a serious problem if you don't have a backup of the keyfile: if you lose the file or the file changes, your database will stay shut forever. The master key options, however, are only one way to of adjusting the balance. There are several other, such as defining the number of key transformations, which makes dictionary attacks against your database more difficult at the cost of increased loading and saving times. You can choose to lock the database after it hasn't been used for a specified amount of time. You can change the time the password stays on your clipboard after copying it (by default it's 12 seconds). There are more, but you should explore them yourself.  The program is feature-rich, and there are many choices one can make, options to fiddle with, and features to test out. One of my personal favorites is the auto-type feature. Instead of copying and pasting your username and password by hand, you select a login form in a website or an application, then find the entry for that login in your KeePass2 database, right-click the entry, and select "Perform Auto-Type" (or optionally just press "Control+V" with the entry selected). Lo and behold, you will see the previous window brought fort, and your username and password rapidly typed into their respective forms, and the login is performed, as if you just pressed Enter after the information was typed. This saves time and effort and is, along with the built-in password generator, probably the most useful single feature for me.  It's not all roses, however. KeePass2 is developed in C#, which is largely a Windows-specific programming language most often used with the Windows-only, proprietary .NET Framework. The Linux version is provided using Mono, an open-source project seeking to create multi-platform .NET Framework-compatible tools. Perhaps partly due to this, and the many different GUI toolkits used across Linux distributions, and possibly due to lack of developer interest, KeePass2 doesn't use the host system's graphical theme. Instead, you get the classic gray-white Windows theme, familiar from the 90's Windows operating systems (and perhaps from modern Wine versions). This doesn't really affect usability, but some minor features of modern Linux toolkits and desktop environments won't work, such as using the scrollbars with a mousewheel when the KeePass2 window is inactive in the background. There are also some missing Windows-specific features, still visible on the Linux version, and other bugs, many of them Mono-related. One of them is the occasional difficulties with copy-pasting text from KeePass2 to some applications (in my case JDownloader).  Even with the silghtly out-of-place visual look and small bugs, I heartily recommend KeePass2 for anyone with over 5 logins to different places. If you're currently using a cloud-based solution for password management, such as LastPass, and have started to feel uncomfortable with having someone else manage your password for you, you can use KeePass2 in conjunciton with a cloud service such as Dropbox to provide largely the same functionality with better overall security. If you're currently using KeePassX, the last stable release of which was in 2010, I recommend that you switch over. It may sound and look unattractive, with the icky Mono-dependence and all, but the overall security and feature improvements of KeePass2 over KeePassX (which is based on KeePass 1.x) are worth it. Unfortunately you can only import KeePassX's .kdb files in the Windows version of KeePass2, as the import library for that format is Windows-only, but if you can handle exporting your passwords to a clearly readable KeePassX XML format for just a moment, you can import your passwords using Linux. If you're worried about the XML file leaving traces to your hard disk, erase the file with "srm" from the "secure-delete" package.  This review was written on 25th of July 2014 on Linux Mint 17 for KeePass2 version 2.25+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1
keepass2~~~1407195151~~~hiwhatsup~~~5~~~perfect on any platform
keepass2~~~1408695370~~~Diesel_F~~~5~~~Llevo un par de meses usándolo en Ubuntu 12.04 en una computadora vieja y tenia algunos problemas, pero en Linux Mint 17 corre sin problemas. Todo al 100.
keepass2~~~1409762085~~~gas_85~~~5~~~Best one!
keepass2~~~1409789502~~~Memnock~~~5~~~Lovely application a most for any secruity minded person
keepass2~~~1409818048~~~Darroch~~~2~~~Looks like a ropey old port from Windows. Poor fonts and many tools and features, e.g., import and password generator, don't work. Better sticking to KeepassX which works faultlessly.
keepass2~~~1410695325~~~Deutel~~~4~~~Tut genau das,was es soll!
keepass2~~~1413263808~~~hurtoty~~~5~~~Genial!!
keepass2~~~1413767418~~~lexcher~~~3~~~Отличное приложение под Windows, но в Linux она выглядит как порт, что печально сказывается на внешнем виде программы. Keepass2 спасают только плагины и удобная связка с KeeFox.
keepass2~~~1414756355~~~dragondon~~~2~~~I've been using KeyPassX for a while and because I bounce between 3 different machines (Home Desktop, Laptop and Tablet) I needed something x-platform.  KeypassX worked fine but synching is now a manual nightmare. So, I found Keepass2 and thought this would be awesome...except it wont import my keypassX(0.4.3) xml file. It goes through the motions but no matter which option chosen, no new entries show up. I really hope that this does improve in the future but for now, leaves business people like me kinda screwed because I don't want to use some other 3rd party synching mechanism(i.e. DropBox).
keepass2~~~1415043641~~~yuhaian~~~5~~~I can use the same password database with KeePassDroid on my phone.
keepass2~~~1415534443~~~Frovy~~~5~~~Very good program to safe password
keepass2~~~1425842309~~~amicalmant~~~5~~~Great piece of secured open source software thanks to the Community. I especially appreciate its cross-platform support and its custom fields features. @dragondon : if you need to open older 1.x files, just use the 'File' -> 'Import' feature as explained in the documentation and stop complaining. :)

keepass2~~~1453762209~~~Bugeater~~~5~~~This program is amazing.  But once again version is way outdated.  Even the PPA has 2.30.  But 2.31 is out and should be the one they give us
keepass2~~~1453841485~~~arghlub~~~5~~~Excellent sofware that works very fine on Linux Debian-based/Ubuntu/Mint and on Windows too.And in addition it is open source !  @Bugeater (no bug to eat here! ツ ) and @ernstlustig  : Effectively, yes in the manager (mintInstall for me on KDE) this is an old version but ... It's veryEasy to update the packages in a manager (mintInstall, aptitude or synaptic) ! The explanation is on this page from debian.org : https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/keepass2/download So, you coud add a single line in a thhe file «/etc/apt/sources.list» 1. Do this with nano for example, in «root» user :  sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list 2. Inside it had the line :  deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian sid main   (change the URL «ftp.fr.debian...» of the server to that of your country. Check it on https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/keepass2/download  ...  3. Save and exit 4. Refresh your package manager :  What do you see ?  «keepass2_2.31+dfsg-1_all.deb»      Et voilà !!!  Don't forget after the installation to delete or comment the line you've added.  ************************ Finally, configure it the «Global Auto-Type» whose options are grayed in the soft.  For the guys who are afraid by the terminal, in this case, you don't have to be what is really very easy !  Enjoy . . . ツ
keepass2~~~1454363422~~~aks1969nl~~~4~~~Excellent in use and simplicity. I use it a lot and I especially like the features to start a website from KeePass. The only thing I haven't tested yet is to add more avatars into it. I made a mistake. I use KeePassX.

keepassx~~~1357755390~~~hterhanian~~~5~~~I've been using this software for a few years now and it is invaluable to me. Highly recommend it.
keepassx~~~1357864066~~~frankIT~~~5~~~Very useful password manager. Indispensable.
keepassx~~~1358398074~~~KoTRpa~~~5~~~grate tool. Best replacement for my creepy memory
keepassx~~~1359342325~~~xtra5~~~4~~~my password keeper
keepassx~~~1359985267~~~fedir~~~5~~~Très bon manager !
keepassx~~~1392340086~~~aneurysm1985~~~5~~~So good. This does exactly what it needs to do. I trust this more than internet-based password vaults (what happens if the server fails?) This allows you to keep your passwords on a secure file on your PC (plus USB drive, personal web server, etc).
keepassx~~~1365807203~~~ulrich3110~~~5~~~Must have on all devices ..
keepassx~~~1367772653~~~remark~~~5~~~Great app. I've used it for years on many devices and platforms. This is on my shortlist of must have software.
keepassx~~~1368449542~~~rainserpent~~~5~~~The features I like best are the different encryption settings and the password generator.
keepassx~~~1370336652~~~StalkerVik~~~3~~~Плохая совместимость с  базой Keepass 2

keepassx~~~1376345584~~~Slickness~~~5~~~How did I manage without Keepass?
keepassx~~~1377390209~~~PatMan~~~2~~~Doesn't open .kdbx file from GDrive; KeePass2 does (Mint 15)
keepassx~~~1380227099~~~DestinTheGreat~~~5~~~Does what I need
keepassx~~~1380438903~~~Osirez~~~4~~~Very useful password manager. Unlike some other popular browser based options this take a little more work to manage.  But on the other hand you can also save local passwords and sync your database using an online sercvice like dropbox.
keepassx~~~1381296184~~~quake0~~~5~~~Great!
keepassx~~~1383214557~~~PabloGyo~~~4~~~ok
keepassx~~~1383294267~~~gillescasetou~~~5~~~i like all in this pass manager never problems
keepassx~~~1383303864~~~aforjeh~~~1~~~Doesn't open kdbx files - using KeePass2 instead!
keepassx~~~1383320039~~~disPPlay~~~4~~~Great open source password manager.
keepassx~~~1385029212~~~Kiru~~~5~~~Crossplatform. Thats the highlight!
keepassx~~~1385046172~~~milosvelickovic~~~4~~~I've just tried it for the first time, and it looks like great password manager. Combined with online storage programs like dropbox, ubuntuone and copy, I'll never forget any password again :). Thanks!!!
keepassx~~~1386615646~~~Chaotajo~~~4~~~Best cross-platform password manager I have used. The u.i. is butt-ugly though.
keepassx~~~1388297724~~~schmoove~~~5~~~mint 16 x64 mate: runs perfectly, cross platform, best password manager around today, easy to use, can open keepass 1 databases
keepassx~~~1389023982~~~dogfight~~~5~~~Flawless for 2 years!  Saved database on thumbdrive.  Access with desktop icon on Linux machine and run from thumbdrive with using Windows machine at work.  Perfect!
keepassx~~~1389290108~~~freccio21~~~5~~~perfect on: laptop linux mint xfce + mobile androide + pc windows + usbKey portable software. You can use it everywhere/always
keepassx~~~1389827238~~~jamvaru~~~2~~~no more secure than lastpass, ultimately; if they want you they will get you; too bad about the name; not version 2 (duh?)
keepassx~~~1389894015~~~lala-rob~~~5~~~Great open source password manager
keepassx~~~1390227315~~~Yure~~~5~~~É uma maravilha, suas senhas estarão seguras, mas veja se não esquece a senha-mestra; não tem como recupará-la.
keepassx~~~1391995039~~~kc6ufm~~~3~~~Just got this. Seems to work, but lacks an intuative interface.
keepassx~~~1395624094~~~picassoz~~~4~~~Have been using in Windows for some years, and in my android devices for 18 months. Syncs well, and is easy to use. For improved security in Windows I use a floating keyboard to log in.
keepassx~~~1458586672~~~lib2know~~~5~~~great tool to stay secure through all  the login accounts
keepassx~~~1399046626~~~Yacy~~~5~~~Thanks for this awesome password manager!

keepassx~~~1405166334~~~idalmir~~~5~~~Gerenciador das minhas senhas, organizado e simplês de usar.
keepassx~~~1406219194~~~MatthewCushman~~~1~~~Not exactly what you're expecting... won't open .kdbx files, for instance.  KeePass2 is what you want.
keepassx~~~1406776701~~~kladizkov~~~5~~~Great software to keep passwords. It is portable across platforms
keepassx~~~1407558382~~~CarlosRosado~~~5~~~Excellent software, but beware IT ONLY MANAGES KEEPASS v1 FILES
keepassx~~~1407790362~~~bashbang~~~5~~~Love this tool, use it all the time. But the repo is way out of date.  Someone really shoudl upgrade this as they now have V2.X

keepassx~~~1408089284~~~jim23~~~5~~~outstanding software and really easy to use
keepassx~~~1410204103~~~akhilesh~~~5~~~Great! You don't have to remember lots of password just remember master key.
keepassx~~~1410671785~~~Jordan_Queiroz~~~5~~~Simple, secure and usefull =)
keepassx~~~1412277179~~~StormBeast~~~5~~~Secure and to the point. Everything you need from a password manager, none of what you don't.
keepassx~~~1415553155~~~wraithwhispers~~~5~~~Use it with a Dropbox share between my wife and I. Now we don't have to ask each other for passwords for financial stuff, and we can have a unique password for each site.
keepassx~~~1415639764~~~AUserInEssex2~~~3~~~*Mods*: I accidentally sent my last review before it was finished. Implement a confirm button?
keepassx~~~1416046435~~~Frugivore~~~5~~~No competition here; this is the absolute best password manager on Linux (and I've practically tried them all). It can be improved, like everything, but this is a must.
keepassx~~~1419436979~~~TJGeezer~~~5~~~The best Linux password keeper. I've used it for years.
keepassx~~~1420938077~~~zbyna~~~5~~~Love it :-)

keepassx~~~1439885582~~~reddot~~~5~~~i dont recommend the ppa, 0.4.3 is way easier to manage, and allot more stable
keepassx~~~1440349754~~~immortal222~~~5~~~excellent !!!
keepassx~~~1441430690~~~badavoid~~~5~~~Excelente gestor de contraseñas. Sencillo de usar y con funcion de auto-escritura para mayor rapidez.
keepassx~~~1441543737~~~frontal_cortex~~~5~~~Very good!!
keepassx~~~1443775729~~~Thasan~~~4~~~Great, but had to install wine+keepass to convert kdbx file to kdb, because this dosen't support kdbx ... And later I find out that keepas2 is available. Switching to that
keepassx~~~1442384499~~~agnaldomin~~~4~~~parece bom, estou testando
keepassx~~~1443318215~~~greggha~~~5~~~Excellent time saver!
keepassx~~~1443684780~~~BDskii~~~4~~~Первая версия не умеет работать с kdbx. Бета версия keepassx2 ещё сыровата и имеет намного меньше настроек чем keepass2 но в принципе вполне работоспособна.
keepassx~~~1444268932~~~duljoni~~~4~~~manager sandi bagus
keepassx~~~1452327173~~~dave3urn~~~5~~~Amazing and simple password manager and generator
keepassx~~~1453762096~~~Bugeater~~~4~~~Version 2.0 is out and is AWESOME.  Why are we using 0.4.3 still?  We need to keep these repositories much more up to date.
keepnote~~~1387201747~~~Korpu~~~4~~~Works well, but it's very different from other hierarchical note-taking applications, not suitable for me. Has easily recoverable file format, html. Default 3-pane view could be reduced to 2-pane view by dragging borders. Rich text format, allows insert graphics and more. But: it has very weak import options, tthough extensions only, not in main program, and for Basket and NoteCase files only. Most similar programs have extremely rich importing options. I'm trying to find replacement for TreePad, that doesn't work well im Mint 16 Cinnamon, and most of my files are in this format and now they will unusable.
keepnote~~~1392248857~~~ravenheart~~~5~~~Solid.  Great Program.  Really like that notes are actually stored in real folders in html format, which means your data is secure.  No proprietary formats.  And the actual notetaking interface looks good & works smoothly.  I have about 10 launchers for seperate Keepnote notebooks on my desktop, which I use for all my vast notes on different hobbies, work projects, etc.  (And when multiple notebooks are opened at the same time, they are shown as tabs in the interface...very nice.  All of the tree icons can be color-coded as well to give a crisp, at-a-glance organized look.  I probably have close to 3,000 pages of notes in this program.
keepnote~~~1394098786~~~toxision~~~4~~~Keepnote is great in organizing hierarchical notes. It simply creates an easy to use tree where notes can be grouped, childs created etc.. The only sad thing is that in the default repository is the last "stable" release, which in my experience is some slow and contains bugs. Instead i can suggest to use the last created beta version 0.7.9, to find as a PPA or different packages on the website. However unfortunately it seems the development has stopped in 2012 and no enhancement of such a great app will be available. But anyway as said the last released beta is the best choice.
keepnote~~~1436695203~~~Trage~~~5~~~exactly what I always wanted.
keurocalc~~~1443011783~~~Rebel450~~~2~~~could be more up to date ...
kexec-tools~~~1418492265~~~AUserInEssex2~~~2~~~Didn't work for me (on 17.1 x64 Cinnamon, with kernel 3.16.0.28).
kexi~~~1430065966~~~inksi~~~4~~~Greatly improved in recent incantations. More stable, more features. You really need to build a later version than offered here. I use it all day, every day, from a postgresql server. Good development team actively working on it fixing bugs, adding new features, etc.
kexi~~~1378584093~~~clarkfk~~~2~~~Faster than Base, but OMG so difficult to use. Lacks a lot of common-sense features. Claims to be an MS Access alternative but fails miserably. Do yourself a favor - install MySQL instead.
kexi~~~1391960484~~~ravenheart~~~4~~~Great program.  More intuitive to use, & more stable than Libre/OpenOff Base.  Uses Sqlite by default, but can also use MySql or Postgres as database server.  BUT it takes ver 2.7.5 for Linux Mint 16 Cinnamon 64.  Interface is considerably broken with the version 2.7.2 that's currently in the repository.   I was able to add the following ppa to software manager in Linux Mint 16 Cinnamon (64-bit), making Kexi 2.7.5 available for install. Kexi functions just fine now.  ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
kexi~~~1453750148~~~lib2know~~~2~~~good ideas. be cautios with the sql button when opening queries (at least if the database type is "file"). there are two features missing to create a productive database user interface: listboxes (or a datagrid) and subforms
key-mon~~~1404221704~~~RytronII~~~5~~~Very handy for video tutorials.
keyboard-configuration~~~1443950598~~~iosonoscrive~~~5~~~ok ok

kfritz~~~1320412989~~~tux-lux~~~5~~~If you have an Fritz!Box so this application is perfect . I am using Linux Mint Katya 64-bit and Gnome. You need the 0.0.8 Version. I like it very much. Thanks!
kfritz~~~1392550739~~~bluehair~~~5~~~No problems. Needs longer time for installation. Expertmode is not what I wish, use,  as Expertmode.

kget~~~1359885425~~~annadaprasad~~~1~~~Go and fuck yourself, Kget. This is the shittiest download manager I've ever seen. I had downloaded 1.5 GiB of 2 GiB and due to some problem had to restart my Computer. After I restart, open Kget. I see nothing. No download info.  And I had to restart download again. This happened 2 times. Even mozilla's download manager is 110% better. Useless piece of shit.
kget~~~1361737360~~~DocPainkiller~~~5~~~Absolutely the best download manager for x. Works fine on MATE. And don't listen to noobs)).
kget~~~1364294690~~~settara~~~1~~~hi had download 1.2 gb of 1.3 gb and i restart my computer .after i restart ,i see nothing no download info and i had to downlod agaon .gwget is 200% better .
kget~~~1392878521~~~RedBlade7~~~4~~~KGet is not the "best" download manager featurewise, but it's definitely the most stable.

kget~~~1410261085~~~masud4122~~~1~~~when i hide menu bar i cann't restore it
kget~~~1418579018~~~asmerm~~~2~~~Stuck in a stone age... Every other download manager  is better than this one.
kget~~~1419180862~~~guises~~~4~~~I like KGet but the description is incorrect - it no longer supports scheduled downloads. That feature was dropped in the transition to KDE 4.
kgoldrunner~~~1293074129~~~wchsmathman14~~~5~~~I played Lode Runner on my Commodore 64 when I was a kid...this game is very similar.
kgoldrunner~~~1443949964~~~iosonoscrive~~~4~~~Good

kgpg~~~1330619125~~~f3ck4r~~~5~~~the best so far D;
kgpg~~~1392878440~~~RedBlade7~~~5~~~Great GnuPG frontend/utility, similar to the closed-source freeware GPGshell for Windows.
khangman~~~1395445163~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~It's funny. Yet I hope there could be more themes (just four?). Configuration possibility is good.
kicad~~~1450709615~~~KarlZeilhofer~~~5~~~install with ppa, not with the software manager! I'm a professional electronics developer. All my work is done with KiCad. In the last 2 years it has improved dramatically. The contributions from the CERN developers are great! The hierarchical schematics are great and the export to the industry standard format (GERBER) works perfectly. Keep up the development of this great suite!
kicad~~~1343097652~~~DJPhil~~~5~~~A great place to start learning EDA software. Open source, so no restrictions like Eagle. Best for simpler designs using through hole or single sided boards. 3D preview and hundreds of footprints and models in the community. Less flexible than gEDA, but easier to learn.
kicad~~~1370686125~~~drfaust~~~4~~~A great and full-featured project. However, it is harder to use than DipTrace. It should force yourself to study it.
kicad~~~1370794679~~~Ichag~~~3~~~Es gibt bessere Programme auch Kostenlos für Privat
kicad~~~1390041064~~~pfreris~~~4~~~A great and efficient EDA software

kid3~~~1383293121~~~reeslo~~~5~~~Very nice, easy to use !!
kid3~~~1401080371~~~BillV~~~5~~~what is the difference between kid3 and kid3-qt?
kid3-qt~~~1274647806~~~almar~~~4~~~Works in an intuitive way.
kid3-qt~~~1278036424~~~masoko~~~5~~~Muy bueno,para aquel que quiere etiquetar sus .mp3's es esencial
kid3-qt~~~1280017080~~~aneurysm1985~~~3~~~Sorry, but I couldn't get the hang of this one. The functionality was not intuitive for me. Am using the excellent free Mp3tag software through WINE instead.
kid3-qt~~~1288737587~~~30ctsparer~~~4~~~The best Audio and ID3 tagging tool is "Audio Tag Tool"
kid3-qt~~~1290104298~~~ExoDoom~~~2~~~No es muy intuitivo, pero una vez trasteas un poco con él, hace lo que se supone que debe hacer
kid3-qt~~~1315700407~~~damirv~~~5~~~Better than Easytag - more options.
kid3-qt~~~1321796704~~~Hithlinel~~~3~~~Although I like this app I was frustrated that the maximum track number is 255. For multi-CD albums I use for example 0516 to represent CD 5 track 16. Not currently possible in this app.
kid3-qt~~~1323265145~~~phobie~~~5~~~The best tagging tool for big collections. It also has a great file parser/renamer. Use
kid3-qt~~~1324478174~~~newel~~~4~~~Easy to use. However the play function does not work
kid3-qt~~~1332086565~~~gmanuel89~~~5~~~The best and easiest tag editor out there - Qt interface for non-KDE DEs

kid3-qt~~~1377085269~~~dudditz~~~5~~~This is the only tag editor that has actually worked to change album art for me!
kid3-qt~~~1455481934~~~Maikzu~~~5~~~Great tool. Wouldn't know what to do without it. It can add album pics to file metadata, do new tags from filename as bunch operation (select all -> new 2-tag) and everything it says on the tin. Just very, very good tool. Thank you, whoever created this.
kid3-qt~~~1401080300~~~BillV~~~5~~~what is the difference between kid3-qt and kid3? both are installed on my pc (forgot which one i was using, but it is awesome)
kid3-qt~~~1441495491~~~MikeF90000~~~5~~~One of the very few tagging tools that lets you compare and selectively copy data between v2 and v1 tags; committing changes is a separate action. Very intuitive and user friendly.
kigo~~~1377919563~~~naguzani~~~4~~~Es divertido.
kigo~~~1393569797~~~TheBigH~~~2~~~Crashes for any engine except gnugo.
kiki~~~1296273782~~~InverseHypercube~~~5~~~This is a great little tool. It's invaluable if you use regex.
kiki~~~1308519052~~~UncleNinja~~~5~~~Extremely useful.
kiki~~~1427590473~~~kaamos~~~4~~~It works when it does. But if you keep using it for some inexplicable reason it consumes 100% CPU and then becomes unresponsive.
kildclient~~~1364533379~~~jijames~~~3~~~It was ok. The deal-breaker for me was the lack of an easy to configure multi-line send on trigger.
kile~~~1281677269~~~dbpatankar~~~4~~~So far, after trying many (La)tex editors, nothing can beat kile when it comes to user interface. Includes many features and command completion along with newly added word completion is awesome when you sit for writing thesis. Only Texmaker comes closer to it.
kile~~~1295657198~~~InverseHypercube~~~5~~~Excellent feature-filled LaTeX editor. It has quick PDF export, but is not WYSIWYG, meaning you learn LaTeX syntax. It also saves in standard .tex files unlike LyX, which is a big plus.
kile~~~1314621831~~~MajorGrubert~~~4~~~Fonctionne assez bien et très pratique malgré le côté usine à gaz
kile~~~1322148730~~~IgnatiusReilly~~~5~~~The best LaTeX editor

kile~~~1355484486~~~felihommen~~~5~~~Extraordinario editor de LaTeX lleno de detalles útiles. Me gusta especialemente el autocompletado de palabras. Recuerda instalar kile-l10n para tenerlo en español..

kimagemapeditor~~~1388971115~~~cork~~~5~~~Very versitile & useful for making HTML links in different areas of an image.
kino~~~1272919936~~~albert22~~~5~~~Kino is probably the best Linux video editor that I have used: 1. It doesn't crash often 2. It has many many features not found elsewhere 3. It is well documented 4. It captures video 5. It's interface is intuitive and doesn't resemble a 1980's video arcade game or Windows. For example, show me an editor with a 'dvtitler' that actually works, is previewed live and can stick the time and date of the footage onto the frame(s), other than Kino?
kino~~~1288215572~~~30ctsparer~~~4~~~It's easy to use, but comes with very limited features. I like OpenShot better.
kino~~~1296763092~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Very cool :-)

kipi-plugins~~~1316831385~~~Kain~~~5~~~Makes digikam more useful.
kipi-plugins~~~1354230035~~~prefersummer2~~~5~~~Excellent. Export to HTML makes an image gallery from a folder of jpgs, to put online in seconds. Image resize does batch resize and there are many others.
kipi-plugins~~~1357157054~~~fotonix~~~5~~~I found the expro blending worked very nicely for me, thank you.
kipi-plugins~~~1357538537~~~anandrkris~~~4~~~Enriches features for Gwenview and Digikam. However faced issues with Open GL effects while running slideshow.
kiriki~~~1340734691~~~Drax~~~5~~~Excellent. Works very well.
kiriki~~~1397869655~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~Adictive indeed. Maybe some themes for background, or possibility for fonts customization. Anyway, good game for those lovers of mental challenges (and lucky ones).

kismet~~~1300932203~~~miana~~~1~~~Kismet doesn't show up in my laptop, and I cannot find Kismet anywhere in my laptop. It doesn't show up after I restarted laptop either. So I think this app is useless.
kismet~~~1310733962~~~linuxnpl~~~2~~~not shown in start menu
kismet~~~1316281988~~~rwttaber~~~5~~~I use the version from kismets site, as the Ubuntu repos have stoped updating it. Everyone who sais they can't find the application should not be using it.

kismet~~~1337856837~~~blackbird80~~~5~~~Great tool ! It doesnt show up in start menu, because it is started via command line, although it has a user-friendly interface. Fully agree with rwtabber, additonally its always a good idea to read the manual.

klavaro~~~1273957246~~~Esteis~~~4~~~Big points for the number of languages and layouts supported, and the ability to work with any new layout you specify. Minus-points for the didactic method being sub-optimal. Still usuable as practice material, though. Bonus points for 'no enforcement': you can skip back or ahead to any lesson you wish.
klavaro~~~1274917926~~~Canid~~~3~~~Funciona, tá valendo!!!
klavaro~~~1281968895~~~flor_de_azucena~~~4~~~There're not many typing tutors that support Russian, and Klavaro is the best of them. Even my 70-year old dad can type now with good speed.
klavaro~~~1283984018~~~5_O_Clock_Charlie~~~4~~~Seems pretty good so far !
klavaro~~~1296531456~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Graphical typing tutor beyond the command-line one I tried. It doesn't need much else installed under gtk. The interface is very simple but not skimping on the features, so it is neither distracting nor intimidating.
klavaro~~~1299467751~~~derschreckliche~~~4~~~a bit monotonous in the beginning but helps to develop "good habits"

klavaro~~~1407695433~~~crimsonmane~~~5~~~This is the better typing tutor. It does not run in terminal like gtypist does. The author incorporated humor into the comments the program gives. It has a more positive feel while gtypist is very cold. It seems to track progress so you pick up where you left off.
klavaro~~~1420236684~~~3dBloke~~~5~~~Excellent software. Well written and easy to use. I've been meaning to learn to touch-type for many years. Klavaro may be what finally gets me there :)

kmail~~~1271330839~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~I switched from Thunderbird 2.x to Thunderbird 3.x to Kmail with KDE 4.4.2 on Helena and find it a much easier client to use then TB3. The online documentation is good and the integration iwith the rest of KDE means everything just works. I like the spam and virus wizards and the options to create comprehensive filters for incoming mail. I use it with three IMAP accounts. Together with Digikam and Firefox my most used application.
kmail~~~1287238922~~~nkspro~~~5~~~Much better customization than tb, easy navigation, good features and better adapted in kde environ
kmail~~~1308991749~~~ugubabba~~~5~~~my favorite mail client on kde / as part of kde pim

kmail~~~1407301389~~~hexavex~~~5~~~After trying thunderbird (stuck in the 90's), Evolution (stuck in molasas), Kmail was a pleasant surprise. It is fast and reliable. You have full control over the settings, so any issues are likely your own fault. Great software.
kmail~~~1426775710~~~vmarijus~~~2~~~I have tried to use it several times, but give up - it works OK with small amount of mails and no filters only
kmail~~~1432909239~~~Seadart~~~1~~~Thunderbird is much better

kmplayer~~~1299533679~~~will_iron~~~5~~~me encanta
kmplayer~~~1347031238~~~688a~~~4~~~One of the best player in Windows.  Hope it is good in Linux too.

kmymoney~~~1344016730~~~pef_~~~5~~~I've been using it weekly for more than 4 years now, for my personal accounting (ok, sometimes only monthly).  Once you understand how double-entry accounting works, it's very straightforward to use. I particularly like the automatic payee matches when importing ofx files, the scheduled transactions, the budgeting feature and the reports that come with it.  Speaking of the reports, one small cons : they're highly customizable but still, at times you may be frustrated by the lack of this or that little tweak.  Overall, however, it's a really, really good piece of software, well-thought and highly reliable : though I can remember it crashed once, I never lost any data in those past 4 years (even after fiddling with the xml file).
kmymoney~~~1358339757~~~emtiu~~~5~~~I've been using this software for six years (no joke!), and it's been doing wonders for me. Just magnificent!
kmymoney~~~1373731496~~~MelW~~~5~~~Very good software. It does everything MS Money used to do on Windows and so far (over 6 months now) has been very reliable on both Mint 14 and 15. The only disadvantage is the amount of KDE stuff that is installed with it, but if you can put up with that it's excellent.
kmymoney~~~1378899149~~~tuxlepingouin56~~~4~~~Mes comptes au quotidien
kmymoney~~~1393455413~~~Kajko~~~5~~~Excellent software to keep control of your finances!
kmymoney~~~1396986382~~~podxboq~~~5~~~Much more complete than paid software in windows or mac.
kmymoney~~~1406641788~~~rdipippo~~~4~~~Would be nice to access the calculator from within the program instead of separate.
kmymoney~~~1414460914~~~seedlessboy~~~5~~~Excellent software! Replaces Quicken, and doesn't leave files all over the place the way Quicken does.
kmymoney~~~1416434211~~~FiretronP75~~~5~~~I really enjoy using this! By far my favorite finance manager!
kmymoney~~~1453445159~~~arez~~~4~~~Не дурно!

kobodeluxe~~~1273924058~~~katchup~~~4~~~Great game, pretty addictive though
kobodeluxe~~~1324643171~~~Kvaks~~~5~~~Addictive! I spent many hours on this game back in the old day. The package description should include the word "xkobo" to match searches for that word.
kobodeluxe~~~1339991445~~~evolmate~~~5~~~Awesome! I agree with katchup - addictive as deadly sins!

My phone runs Maemo and I was looking forward to MeeGo with Calligra and Kontact sync someday but now I'm stuck using Android for mobile and concerned for the future of open source in a mobile world.
kolourpaint4~~~1272268520~~~unexistance~~~4~~~For people who is very used to MS Paint (it a bit more advanced), it's perfect. The downside is the dependencies it pulled-in :P

kolourpaint4~~~1290740662~~~Doruletz~~~5~~~I LOVE IT! Awesome image editing tool. Similar to but better than Win 7 Paint. Not as complex or complete as Gimp, but great none the less.

kolourpaint4~~~1297190757~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Great for a quick doodle! Sometimes it's all you need for a simple graphic. When you don't need fancy, but need to draw, this works nicely.
kolourpaint4~~~1315312617~~~Derathor~~~5~~~A great replacement for MS Paint!
kolourpaint4~~~1335628141~~~Kain~~~4~~~Sure, it's very limited, but sometimes you don't need gimp. Just like ms paint, but better!
kolourpaint4~~~1323733896~~~loopasam~~~4~~~You liked the simplicity and intuitivity of MS Paint? Install that, it's the same but better

kolourpaint4~~~1360181966~~~antonijn~~~5~~~Way better than GPaint for simple graphical tasks.
kolourpaint4~~~1367866470~~~Ikuazu~~~5~~~I use this for small pixel artwork and Kolourpaint is the best I can find, really!

kolourpaint4~~~1418832554~~~jadek~~~5~~~The best overall simple paint program. 4.14 is admittedly unstable, yet in the repositories. 4.8 (from Debian Packages) works fine on LM 17.1 Cinnamon.
kolourpaint4~~~1419838162~~~Hristian_Carabulea~~~2~~~In Mint 17.1 does not work properly. The Tool Box does now show up. I think it has nothing to do with the developer but with  Linux Mint 17.1. No matter,  the software cannot be used 100% any longer.
kolourpaint4~~~1423085204~~~Kobalt~~~1~~~hint: you may use "pinta" as alternative
kolourpaint4~~~1425129117~~~maniac~~~5~~~To use on Mint 17.1, install oxygen-icon-theme-complete.
kolourpaint4~~~1426862963~~~DocZen~~~4~~~Tres pratique. Malheureusement, après l'installation sur LMDE, il n'y a pas de raccourci qui apparait sur le menu. J'ai été obligé de créer un lanceur.
kolourpaint4~~~1427090464~~~ndaidong~~~1~~~Great app! I use it every day. Update: It does not work on LinuxMint 17.1, sorry! Just switched to Pinta as Kobalt suggested.
kolourpaint4~~~1431029601~~~haluk~~~5~~~great... i have just installed kolourpaint on mint 17.1 kde and it works perfect,
kolourpaint4~~~1434067195~~~c123~~~5~~~equal to the paintbrush in windows. :)
kolourpaint4~~~1441921659~~~nokiahelp~~~5~~~kolourpaint is finally working!! I have the Cinnamon edition, and I have installed kdelibs-bin kdelibs5-data kdelibs5-plugins and the program is running normaly. Enjoy this help from linuxmint.com ;-)

komparator~~~1355725426~~~Techknotted~~~4~~~Every needed a Gui software to help eliminate duplicate files in a controlled way? Well came across this little one. A KDE4 Duplicate Files Find And Directory Compare Program.   By Georg Hennig. This is current ly avail in version 6.0 via Synaptics. THis have been a particularly useful program when I moved my Data files off the HDD onto a Backup ext drive. Plus I had a huge amount of digital photos!! Try it and post here your thoughts.

kompozer~~~1269760116~~~ddalley~~~4~~~KompoZer is a separate fork of the old Netscape 7.2 suite. It, along with SeaMonkey's Composer, are the two to use. Two very good 4.01 HTML editors for static web pages. Ignore nvu because it is dead code and buggy.

I've tried the Kompozer on Mint and I can say it is Awesome app. For free you will get nearly the same options like in Adobe Dreamweaver. Everything works perfectly. and comparing the prices ? Adobe = £ 400 - Kompozer = Free ;)
kompozer~~~1335161989~~~freesource~~~3~~~Its free so it get 3 stars anyway! I update after have tried it some months!

When I click on choose program I get a file menu. I'm a newbie to Linux. What should I be doing to open the right program to install Kompozer ? When I look for Kompozer in the software manager, it's not available. Any helpful hints are appreciated.
kompozer~~~1383676874~~~davidswanson1~~~5~~~Thank you! I finally was able to get off Dreamweaver

kompozer~~~1388960806~~~DocGil~~~1~~~All I get is the error message: "Could not find package 'kompozer'"
kompozer~~~1390672918~~~Yuri~~~4~~~For DocGil: Use Synaptic Search & install. Good prog!
kompozer~~~1392499459~~~PsychoticMonkey~~~3~~~"could not find Kompozer" is the message I get
kompozer~~~1392499724~~~linux1492~~~4~~~Great tool! Just it does crash from time to time and especially, when using tables. So if you know how to treat tables with HTML Kompozer is the correct application for you!

kompozer~~~1445288953~~~claycub~~~3~~~Doesn't load from Link above. Go to http://kompozer.net/ and find Link there. User's Manuals are also there. Good luck..i'm new to it also! :)
kompozer~~~1445548938~~~lib2know~~~4~~~i wonder if it is possible to create really good looking webpages. but there are other useful purposes like collecting information from html webpages and rearrange it for own use. Probably Seamonkey is ahead.

kompozer-dev~~~1432911327~~~jahid_0903014~~~4~~~You can add custom plugins for kompozer with this
konqueror~~~1275120260~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~I never use konqueror for web browsing, but it does a great job at file management.
konqueror~~~1279250051~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~It's good for file managment and document viewing but not very good for web browsing
konqueror~~~1281030154~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~It does a good job. But I really prefer other browsers over it.
konqueror~~~1281908183~~~dbpatankar~~~3~~~I use as a file browser but not for web browsing.
konqueror~~~1282594041~~~Raven95~~~5~~~My Favorite Web Browser Also Brilliant For File Management And Document Viewing
konqueror~~~1282812492~~~bobthedog~~~4~~~Great file manager. Slow as a browsar, but much faster if you use the webkit rendering engine rather than khtml - switch it in the drop down menus.
konqueror~~~1286583570~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good for file browser.
konqueror~~~1299182608~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good web browser ;)

konqueror~~~1316728573~~~Examiner~~~4~~~I like it - a lot! The only things that I do not like, are that it is not terribly user-friendly when attempting to sort bookmarks, and the font size on my email is laughable. However, it is fast, clean, and easy on the eyes.

You have associated Konqueror with inode/directory, but it cannot handle this file type." I don't need it for web, I need it for files because Nemo is extremely unstable.

konquest~~~1296963768~~~Xyie~~~4~~~I must admit, I've spent a bit too much time on this game before.
konquest~~~1296972734~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Really quite adictive.
konquest~~~1298556303~~~Tuhin~~~5~~~Addictive! Don't try this game LOL!
konquest~~~1366445565~~~mota~~~3~~~Very simple.
konquest~~~1382057430~~~4ndy~~~3~~~Almost as much a logic puzzle as a strategy game. Knowing the status of every planet but not of enemy fleets in transit leaves this playing like a game of Risk without dice. I enjoyed figuring it out, but it quickly got boring after that. Needs more complex game mechanics.
konquest~~~1392929739~~~taktoa01~~~4~~~Amikor elöször játszottam vele, akkor megragadott.

konsole~~~1271332630~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~I like using the konsole. Transparent black background, bright green text, tab completion - It's like it's 1988 again.
konsole~~~1275345591~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~Powerful terminal emulator with plenty of themes.
konsole~~~1280005491~~~ledjin~~~5~~~I really love it.
konsole~~~1297390791~~~mutput7~~~5~~~My life would NOT be the same without it.
konsole~~~1298558751~~~Googleness~~~5~~~The only terminal emulator which work for me using Hebrew and RTL support.
konsole~~~1395173820~~~skywolfblue~~~5~~~Konsole is a really good Terminal app.
konsole~~~1415611540~~~caspian~~~5~~~IMHO Konsole is the best terminal. I love the ability to type and have input go to all tabs at once.
konsole~~~1424615491~~~Agerskov~~~5~~~Just like to add extra tabs using ctrl-shift-t and shuffle between them using shift and the right/left arrow keys
kontact~~~1308987976~~~ugubabba~~~4~~~still not an Outlook but going there .. slowly
kontact~~~1318334986~~~stleon~~~5~~~Like it
kontact~~~1369862417~~~bsewell~~~3~~~I used to love it. Now it hangs regularly. Buggy and slow.
konversation~~~1297189787~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This is a pretty decent irc client for using while in kde. Very little to be overwhelmed or confused with, but neither lacking in features.
konversation~~~1308583678~~~Ioseph~~~5~~~My fave.
konversation~~~1308587958~~~SeventhReign~~~4~~~The best GUI based IRC client for KDE.  Quassel is just a complete mess ATM.
konversation~~~1392878231~~~RedBlade7~~~5~~~The best GUI-based IRC client for Linux, especially for people who love mIRC on Windows. Other GUI-based clients (e.g. XChat) are terrible.
konversation~~~1436829098~~~Rebel450~~~3~~~am missing Limechat sooo much :-(
konversation~~~1438043778~~~MichaelTunnell~~~5~~~I think Konversation is easily the best IRC client on Linux and possibly all of Computing. The Context-Aware Tab Completion is incredibly useful and should probably be stolen by all other IRC clients.
kopete~~~1267675790~~~GhoS~~~4~~~Very nice all around messenger
kopete~~~1279946487~~~LinuxWiz83~~~5~~~This is probably the best all in one messenger for linux but the only thing that would be nice for it would be facebook and myspace chat
kopete~~~1280221294~~~dequire~~~4~~~A lot of features, but KMess is better if you only use MSN for chatting. Also their homepage @ http://kopete.kde.org isn't updated enough. Still a great KDE Chat Client. "Supports AIM, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise Messenger, and more"
kopete~~~1285262785~~~titohal~~~4~~~Supports many protocols. Some more settings about emoticons and interface would be great. But I think it's the best chat client.
kopete~~~1286026583~~~makifruti~~~2~~~Pero tiene una interface muy amigable y simple!
kopete~~~1288801121~~~realpipster~~~3~~~No Video...needs Jasper. Not sure what that is

kopete~~~1300573029~~~antonio_barros~~~5~~~Ótimo cliente de mensagem instantânea.
kopete~~~1306871222~~~slw_~~~3~~~A little to complicate for my taste. A little bit to many options that I really do not have need for. Works fine though.
kopete~~~1307309466~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Good
kopete~~~1334178563~~~menta1789~~~5~~~MUY BUENO PARA LOS QUE TIENEN KDE
kopete~~~1335697593~~~LeanderPL~~~5~~~Hard to say, but works BETTER than Pidgin :)
kopete~~~1362919894~~~arcorreia~~~4~~~MS is dropping MSN and migrating all accounts to Skype so all our messenger alternatives are a dying race. Install Skype and wait for a Skype compatible GPL program.

korganizer~~~1339986384~~~kowari~~~5~~~wonderful piece of software
korganizer~~~1373296566~~~Maurice045~~~2~~~Unweildy & Clunky, also installs unwanted Akonadi Suite
korganizer~~~1407482846~~~jinlong~~~1~~~I don't know about most people, but I just sync with clouds. Their GUIs are usually more appealing and they're far more versatile.
korganizer~~~1412690751~~~erenor~~~3~~~Does what it's supposed to do. Can be improved, of course.
korganizer~~~1412696284~~~jahid_0903014~~~3~~~so so
korganizer~~~1452618456~~~commanderzero13~~~4~~~Great for managing my schedule, especially for school.  I can see what is do when and can add information on the assignment.  My one wish, that it had the option to make custom calendar notes, such as 'blue color for school, green for personal, red for business' or something
korganizer-mobile~~~1367597830~~~tosim~~~4~~~I prefer this to the standard KOrganizer.

kpackagekit~~~1287525887~~~Inoki~~~5~~~Very handy for keeping your system updated. Does tasks such as critical system update without you having to do it manually. Also, if you need to browse for multiple packages from a specific file, you'll find them all in one place.

kpat~~~1444517388~~~SilverGames~~~5~~~Simple solitaire game that's perfect. Sure, it doesn't have 80 games, but who really plays anything other than FreeCell, Spider and Klondike?
kpat~~~1444851420~~~GadgetGuru~~~5~~~Supports my solitaire addiction nicely.
kpat~~~1445242572~~~gorade~~~4~~~The best solitair I have seen so far. Addictive. Only catch: it litters your system with KDE
kpat~~~1454779262~~~cornell~~~5~~~Used for years under Ubuntu.  Pretty bad under LinuxMint (17.3 Rosa Cinnamon).  Text is missing from menu, there's one ugly illegible card deck, and retrieving additional card decks fails.
kpat~~~1455475789~~~choochooAl~~~5~~~Has some good games.   I'm hung on it.

kppp~~~1407482594~~~jinlong~~~1~~~I guess I understand why this is an automatic install, but it would seem that a prompt should be given during installation, "Do you use Dial-Up?" before this is installed. For most people, it's pointless.
kppp~~~1420692042~~~FantaMix~~~5~~~the best program for computer with GPRS-modem! Thanks
kq~~~1282076786~~~asymmetros~~~1~~~ried it from two different pc's. Awful exprerience. Both the times, the game seems to play by itself. I couldn 't stop it, i was not able to open a terminal or to change desktop at least.

krdc~~~1277766364~~~oguz~~~4~~~Most smart VNC client I tried. But at RDP Gnome-RDP is better.
krdc~~~1279554939~~~stewb~~~4~~~I use this daily to connect with a WindowsXP macxhine running UltraVNC. Krdc does this better than the Gnome client.
krdc~~~1289156145~~~Txnca~~~5~~~Excellent remote desktop client.  I use this to log into my XP box using rdp.  Allows resizing of the main window so that you can still see what you are doing on your Mint desktop.  Only one I've found that will do that.  Very fast and responsive.
krdc~~~1353294285~~~warkd~~~5~~~The best rdp that I have found for working with my windows machines.
krdc~~~1372850538~~~clax~~~5~~~The performance is great and it works well with the 5250 emulator I use on the XP client, which some other RDP clients don't.
krdc~~~1383744384~~~emiandri~~~4~~~Works great for both VNC/RDP!!!

krita~~~1394052490~~~skywolfblue~~~5~~~Krita is way better then GIMP for painting/sketching
krita~~~1396121039~~~3dBloke~~~3~~~Really nice, but does it have to be so dependent on KDE?
krita~~~1400171919~~~ariffav~~~5~~~Close to Corel Painter but I like Krita more because of its smoothness.
krita~~~1416209150~~~Almaska~~~5~~~Excellent for drawing comics. A soft that only gets better with time

krita~~~1437709305~~~Juan-Guillermo~~~5~~~Me gusta.
krita~~~1441739642~~~Allium~~~5~~~Did not work on mint 17.2! There's a newer version! "Krita 2.9" that works. I downloaded this version first, then had to go through the trouble of deleting all the files before installing the newest stable version "krita 2.9". The program itself is absolutely beautiful, and has become a quick favorite for my illustration practice.
krita~~~1443410239~~~Incandescent~~~5~~~Fantastic painting program! Also quite useful for editing images, as it's much easier to use compared to Gimp. Highly recommended!
krita~~~1444341446~~~InfoCentral~~~5~~~This is a very old version.  I would add the PPA or download this from their website.
krita~~~1448789721~~~iosonoscrive~~~5~~~best krita wow

krusader~~~1280409086~~~linXea~~~5~~~my favorite filemanger!
krusader~~~1281713322~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I like it mainly because of it's able to handling archive files as folders. If you're using KDE do not hesitate to install it.

krusader~~~1319041183~~~ostas~~~5~~~I work, I like, I recommend
krusader~~~1319482391~~~nicabod~~~5~~~I love it! Similar in concept to Total Commander (MS Win) Unfortunate name, though

krusader~~~1360441958~~~qLrPi~~~5~~~For a long time searched for a suitable program. Tried 5 - MC, Gnome Commander, Worker, Sunflower, Tuxcmd. If you need a maximally similar to Total Commander, then this is it) Maximum flexibility of settings. The only one that keeps way. Thanks to the developers!
krusader~~~1362639878~~~mitis~~~4~~~I'm spoiled by Total Commander so … :) I've tried many available clones of TC if not all and this one is the best. It's closest to what I'm use to. Works well, many many features. I'm addicted to it, first app I launch after boot.
krusader~~~1363168209~~~wendrock~~~5~~~Ich komme immer wieder zu krusader zurück. Ich finde keine bessere Alternaive.
krusader~~~1363884764~~~amityk~~~5~~~Feels same like Total Commander... Good One... :)

krusader~~~1381863313~~~burak3~~~4~~~Quite nice, but I could not get used to it. I prefere Dual Commander - it is more like Total Commander and is multi-platform ;)
krusader~~~1383072064~~~Justaway~~~5~~~zbs
krusader~~~1383644279~~~fotonix~~~4~~~Knice, but I use Cinnamon, not KDE - and it looks odd using KDE apps with Knone, Kinnamon, etc.  Then I found 'sunflower' and that to me is 5-star now.
krusader~~~1386019317~~~pjanous~~~4~~~best file manager what i found
krusader~~~1393767091~~~playforvoices~~~5~~~Best commander for X.

krusader~~~1398776449~~~gonzalognzl~~~4~~~great. works just fine on my MATE olivia. cons: 181 mb?!

krusader~~~1421490691~~~prabhatjn~~~4~~~use sunflower for mint, may need to install it from using their repository
krusader~~~1435171084~~~flos~~~5~~~Best  File Manager, on Gnu/Linux, for me. Krusader, was one of the amazing programs that made my transition from widow, much more easy.
krusader~~~1435943725~~~Multimedix~~~5~~~Looks like SpeedCommander for Windows! Much Functions! Simple Drag and Drop, F-Keys for Copying, Move, Rename...and so on...! My personal Favorate!

krusader~~~1443873412~~~the_joker~~~5~~~a touch of total commander
krusader~~~1448278711~~~cybernaut~~~5~~~I found an ideal replacement for Total Commander, which I've been using for 20 years as my favourite file manager. Krusader is no less powerful than TC. I reccomend Krusader to all of you who swithced from MS Windows, just as I have. Honestly, I don't look back...
krusader~~~1455098031~~~efkasoft~~~5~~~Very pleasant software. It took some time to discover how to use the directory bookmarks. The bookmark editor has to be loaded by installing konquerer also. Has the same benefit as WinSCP for windows: when editing files from ftp with the built-in editor it will automatically be saved.
krusader~~~1455371790~~~stevegaboda~~~5~~~Просто СУПЕР!!!

ksquares~~~1402197336~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~This reminds me my old school days. The customizable size of the grid is a good idea. Though a "Hard" difficulty level would be more suitable for those nerdy ones, I missed it a bit.
ksquares~~~1404728030~~~Geodot~~~4~~~Nice, you can play alone against Computer Opponent.

kstars~~~1367005598~~~Kshatrya~~~4~~~Very good for planning observing sessions. Good for users wanting more technical capabilities.
kstars~~~1376136210~~~rdelreLM~~~4~~~I like it. I discovered it some time ago and now I have installed in Olivia KDE. I do not know stellarium so I cannot compare. Also, in the past I tried to use it with Gnome but failed - I am not sure, I suppose it works only with KDE
kstars~~~1393712857~~~massasauga~~~5~~~This is a terrific planetarium program. If you run it without parameters, it works with Gnome too.
ksudoku~~~1355063252~~~michelsaey~~~4~~~Good sudoku game
ksudoku~~~1376473256~~~Seadart~~~4~~~One MAJOR problem! Sudoku is a logic game - guessing is no part of it!!! Guessing should not be built in, it destroys the game. Please remove guessing, or if you feel you can't do that; at least give an option to turn it off.
ksudoku~~~1395962868~~~Nethanyahu~~~5~~~I think sudoku is sudoku. End of story. This game adds themes and some good ideas to make that classical even more funny. If capability to get more themes (or customize them), and turn off guessing would be added, that will make KSudoku better. Nevertheless, the game is just addictive. Great job.
ksudoku~~~1409554545~~~jahid_0903014~~~4~~~nice game

ktux~~~1348521750~~~edgefromberlin~~~4~~~Sweet!
kubrick~~~1395974765~~~Nethanyahu~~~4~~~I think this game is a must for every KDE (or Linux) user. A bit of time to get used to game controls. But once I reach that goal, the game re-creates a challenge that never dies through passing of years.
kubuntu-desktop~~~1293557430~~~noman2008~~~4~~~nice
kubuntu-desktop~~~1437700291~~~xkill~~~2~~~en una pc Intel Celeron 1.80 ghz , 1 nucleo , hd de 80 gb y 937,3 MiB de ram con linux mint 17 mate, Probé muchos entornos de escritorio y este fue el ultimo , y tuve que sacarlo y seguir con el escritorio mate porque los demás el rendimiento era bastante mas menor , se me tranca con kde pero con mate me anda mucho mas ligero y no se me tranca porque los demás entornos se me trancan , como por poca memoria , pero eso no me pasa con mate , con mate me anda ligero
kupfer~~~1271328015~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Kuper ist hervorragend für KDE geeignet um, ähnlich wie Gnome-DO, die Bedürfnisse eines Tastaturcowboys zu befriedigen.
kupfer~~~1274688538~~~patriki~~~4~~~Easy tool, must try.
kupfer~~~1275484196~~~bqdbr~~~4~~~Lighweight and great at lauching, still missing some addons, but overall a great replacement to Gnome Do.
kupfer~~~1278772037~~~mareser~~~5~~~Great application. Fast and easy to use. Must have.

kupfer~~~1280788611~~~amb1402~~~5~~~light. and smooth ,better than gnome do
kupfer~~~1282937213~~~acpcalin~~~5~~~Great launcher! Highly recommend it! Although Gnome-Do is pretty good too.
kupfer~~~1288582129~~~leproso~~~5~~~Excelente y muy práctico para ejecutar programas
kupfer~~~1289828799~~~murmelbaer~~~5~~~Great! Test it, like it!
kupfer~~~1295042159~~~autumncorvus~~~5~~~I love it, and much prefer it to Gnome Do. And unlike Gnome Do there's no Mono here! Very customizable and many plugins.
kupfer~~~1295384692~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Very nice.
kupfer~~~1295959631~~~efthialex~~~4~~~good

kupfer~~~1309754336~~~opensas~~~4~~~simply put, just can't live without it
kupfer~~~1310575079~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~It has some neat features that make it superior to gnome-do.
kupfer~~~1314199287~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~works very well in KDE
kupfer~~~1311945458~~~Inoki~~~5~~~This has proven to be extremely useful and works. Saves you ample time while working. Don't know where your files are located but you know their name? Kupfer finds them for you, with a few keystrokes you're editing / viewing / playing your files in no time!
kupfer~~~1313847620~~~hessam~~~5~~~5* Simple & Powerfull
kupfer~~~1314036555~~~fooquit~~~5~~~Fast, flexible and powerful launcher. Lighter and more featureful than Gnome Do.
kupfer~~~1314797098~~~OnesimusUnbound~~~5~~~good application launcher that will prioritize the frequently used application. Can search for file.
kupfer~~~1316977641~~~whysoyjuan~~~3~~~Es un buen lanzador,es rapido y con muchos complementos pero me quedo con gnome-do que me gusta mas la interface y aparte que en kupfer no veo la opcion de acceder a las preferencias desde el lanzador sino que tiene que ser desde el icono de notificacion o con una combinacion de teclas.Por lo demas genial...pienso que para equipos de potencia media/baja es mas que perfecto..tiene mas productividad que elegancia en su diseño.
kupfer~~~1345030000~~~ALF-Berlin~~~2~~~Nachteile: kein Vollbildmodus, wenig Anzeigefläche von mitten auf dem Bildschirm nach unten, zeigt nicht die Eingabe, zeigt Alternativen nur nach Drücken der Pfleil-nach-unten-Taste, zeigt nur wenige Alternativen, startet Webseiten nur im Firefox
kupfer~~~1352889433~~~RytronII~~~5~~~A must have!
kupfer~~~1354702141~~~prefersummer2~~~3~~~This didn't work too well for me. Both Gnome-do and Synaptic worked much better.

kwrite~~~1290215555~~~DmonX~~~4~~~great and easy
kwrite~~~1298709514~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~Good, with a text/alphabet (default) is more slim and colorful.

kwrite~~~1334500043~~~ulysses~~~3~~~KDE-Times often used.
kwrite~~~1338285121~~~paulgk~~~3~~~Kwrite is good editor for manipulating text file. Fantastic and ease in use is mode "regular expression".  Option in menu "Replace" for find and replace any pattern is very usable. This is very good software.
kwrite~~~1340123513~~~happyguy~~~4~~~good
kwrite~~~1430571287~~~ukuphila~~~5~~~The best text editor ever! Very very light!

laborejo~~~1409194905~~~Arrowsociety~~~4~~~Would love to see this improved upon!!
laby~~~1284952016~~~Xyie~~~3~~~It gets done what it claims, teaches you how to program a little bit. The learning game itself feels like it could use much more polish, but nothing gets in the way of using it. Not spectacular, but it doesn't try to be fancy.
laby~~~1308093284~~~smag~~~5~~~cool!
laby~~~1384467835~~~captainmorgan85~~~5~~~As someone who has been dabbling in code for years, this was a fun excercise in algorithms!  Be warned that it does NOT save your code when you close the game.
laby~~~1427971658~~~josefg~~~3~~~Nice, but somehow I still prefer RUR-PLE.
labyrinth~~~1313876465~~~Averell~~~2~~~Pas assez d'options pour un mindmapping Preferer Vym
labyrinth~~~1344996101~~~tql1Qu~~~2~~~A pure  functional. No localization
labyrinth~~~1346076626~~~aztec~~~5~~~This is a real gem of a program as the interface does not get in the way. OK it's being developed I guess, but hopefully not over developed like vym. Less is more, great stuff so far.
labyrinth~~~1399406753~~~Danko8321~~~5~~~Really great. Totally recomended.
labyrinth~~~1407667548~~~yason~~~4~~~Саме те, що я і шукав. Досить просто, але можна довільно встановлювати зв’язки між комірками.
labyrinth~~~1413384846~~~Korpu~~~4~~~Program is very efficient, but help is not helpful. In short: click on canvas creates node, type content, click anywhere else on canvas to finish node creation. It's autosaves. Link is auto created between 2 nodes: last clicked on and one you are creating now. To eliminate this link, use Shift key to select by clicking both nodes, then go to menu Edit > Create Link. Existing link will diappear. Connecting unconnected nodes is done the same way. Drag node to put it in different place. Aerial view by Zoom out icon on the top, restoring by Zoom1 icon. Has 2 windows, list of maps and particular map's view. For me it's more efficient and faster than XMind and CompendiumNG. I highly recommend it.

laptop-mode-tools~~~1417052647~~~AUserInEssex2~~~3~~~A program called TLP is better although TLP has some (fixable . .) USB glitches.
laptop-mode-tools~~~1426188308~~~lauramacfan~~~4~~~For those who wrote that "does nothing with Linux Mint 17" or that it doesn't works: IT WORKS PERFECTLY! I'm testing it right now. You must launch the application from terminal, writing the following command: sudo lmt-config-gui How do you get there? Click on "Menu", search for "Laptop Mode Tools Configurations Tool" then right click on it and choose "Add to desktop". From there, right click on the icon, then on "Properties" and in the "Command" line you'll see the real name of this software. Launch it from the terminal with the command I've previously wrote: the Laptop Mode Tools Configuration Tool panel will appear. All you have to do now is to choose which option suits your laptop the most, or to just accept the standard configuration. Either way, to allow the tool to work, you'll have to click on "Apply". If you have problems deciding, just linger with the mouse over each option and a small window will appear explaining you their functions. Before writing that a software is not working giving it 1 star, you have to make sure that you are doing things correctly, which means that you should know how to use Linux and its the terminal, that you read other useful reviews, asked other users for help, or that you did an online search about the program, which in many cases will bring you to the official developers website containing the instructions for their app (otherwise you can send them an email). This is my first review here, I hope it has been helpful.

I use this in windows and I can consider it like essential, I'm new to linux, here in mint 17 kde doesn't work it's a sad because is an awesome productivity tool to start to move around fast ( it loses focus and closes itself ). I just found Alt+F2  is similar but I miss launchy.  Cheers

lazarus~~~1310935673~~~trollboy~~~4~~~I have just had a shiver go down my spine. In a good way. This reminds me of Delphi (Kylix on Linux) from Borland. I'll have to look into this as I may have found my primary programming home, along with C. Ah nostalgia :)

lazarus~~~1378583238~~~nmadani~~~5~~~The most productive IDE/RAD tool for Linux bar none. Use the latest verion (currently 1.0.12) from the developers directly rather than this outdated version here. Installation is easy.
lazarus~~~1379304538~~~seier~~~4~~~This is an excellent programming tool, I'm retaining the 5, because the help system needs examples like AutoIT and Inno Setup have.  Please update the package there's no reason to be so far behind on such a popular package.

lbreakout2~~~1292179689~~~Trinexx~~~3~~~Good game, good graphics, good sound. That said, I never thought I'd play a BORING breakout clone. Major yawn-fest, this game.
lbreakout2~~~1292195612~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~:) One of the first games I played was the breakout sample in Turbo Pascal 7.0. Back then I felt that was an awesome game. I know this is a simple game and there are breakout-type games much more interesting than this, but it's still a lot of fun and I enjoy it every time I play it. :)

lbreakout2~~~1314643965~~~mmskywalker~~~4~~~Reminds me of the good old Amiga days :-)
lbreakout2~~~1314704344~~~trollboy~~~4~~~Simple and fun
lbreakout2~~~1319573789~~~AlmightyDoerOfStuff~~~1~~~Too many controls, too many options, unnecessary multiplayer modes. (I don't see the draw of a four-player Breakout deathmatch. Maybe it's just me.) Way too much... STUFF, for what should be a simple, fun timewaster game. The graphics are creepy and unpleasant. Furthermore, the balls turned red at one point and then the game just quit two seconds later. Not what I want from a Breakout clone. I prefer gnome-breakout, despite its age and half-finishedness.
lbreakout2~~~1327958636~~~fabietto0102~~~2~~~boring, too many bricks... not funny and entertaining!
lbreakout2~~~1336471540~~~Mazhar~~~5~~~Not bad. funny.

libasound2-plugin-equal~~~1326347826~~~semint~~~1~~~This is not a package, this is a virus that ruins your system. After installing this I couldn't boot Mint 12, and looking at the "impact on packages" it's not hard to see why.  Don't install this crap.

libaudio-dev~~~1392498034~~~linux1492~~~2~~~This lib is certainly useful, but I did experience lots of upward compability problems. So it was till now lots of stress to use this lib ....
libav-tools~~~1413807802~~~jcxz100~~~5~~~This set of tools are command line only and the full help for their options makes up I'd say around 100 screens of closely packed info - of which you'll probably only ever use 10 to 15. Just my kind of tool :) Btw: I prefer libav over the closely related ffmpeg tools, mostly because of the philosophy behind the development. Also ffmpeg seems a little slower in adapting new features. But from the enduser's perspective there is very little difference.
libav-tools~~~1452349634~~~tr0nic~~~5~~~This codec is awesome - encodes and decodes tons of media file formats and more....!  :)
libavcodec-extra~~~1413807132~~~jcxz100~~~5~~~It is pretty impossible to get an explanation of why you will need this package, "libavcode-extra", rather than plain "libavcodec". See for instance this ubuntu forums question: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1423948 (it is from 2010 and still unanswered). But my guess is that you won't have for instance mp3 ability without it (no, I didn't test that). After all the "MPEG-1 & -2 Audio Layer III" specifications are copyright by Fraunhofer IIS et al., and these companies have every right to one day ask everyone in the world to pay for the use of it... not a likely scenario, but still it could possibly be the reason for having a libavcodec that does not support it.

librecad~~~1410262839~~~osvifur~~~4~~~This version has the same good drawing features as before, some of them improved. Exporting high quality images for publications is still problematic - svg output was added, which is a good thing, but some basic output features (jpg, png, svg), in particular if in color, can crash your whole sesson (requering new login and crashing all your other programs). Be very careful with this.

libreoffice~~~1352673694~~~photoao~~~3~~~Software manager pretends it's not installed, but synaptic knows it IS. Liberoffice might be useful at times, but like every other office package, it's bloated. In most cases, Abiword and gnumeric do the job very well.

libreoffice~~~1358142153~~~manojprabhu_d~~~5~~~Been using LibreOffice for over 3 years now (since the time it used to be openoffice). Best FOSS office suite that can give commercial suites a run for their money. Try it for at least 2-3 months and then decide for yourself!
libreoffice~~~1359573941~~~yatriparis~~~4~~~Writer and Calc yes - Impress compatibilty not so good
libreoffice~~~1360427942~~~nzc3~~~5~~~I just love it it gets better and better all the time. Also language support for ES and DE is perfect!

libreoffice~~~1371285742~~~AndyVanMokum~~~2~~~Promises to be good but fails because of the persistant spell check bug. Until this is fixed, the programme is as much good as a chocolate teapot. Can't waste any more time trying to find a solution. Will be using Openoffice, at least the spell check works.

libreoffice~~~1386568745~~~arper24~~~4~~~Its well enough
libreoffice~~~1389326401~~~ravenheart~~~5~~~Excellent alternative to office.  Base is also an excellent front-end, but be sure to use the free templates online to setup your databases in split-databse format.  Know the difference between embedded & split-databases before you begin with Base.  It's ultra stable & reliable when split.
libreoffice~~~1390226945~~~Voliax~~~5~~~Great patch. Recommended!

libreoffice~~~1394713172~~~mazinga~~~5~~~Great Office suite, but has to improve some programs. Impress has to improve a lot, it's slow, has not so much features. Presentations exported as Powerpoint XML files are always messed up.
libreoffice~~~1395173309~~~skywolfblue~~~4~~~An excellent alternative to MS office! I've been using the word equivalent for a while now with no issues.
libreoffice~~~1395734287~~~ukuphila~~~5~~~LibreOffice is the best LIFE office suite! LibreOffice is the best LIFE office suite, because LibreOffice is of KDE, Germany!

libreoffice~~~1400527166~~~juandiego~~~5~~~No le veo ninguna pega.

libreoffice~~~1411487973~~~myrkat~~~5~~~Whole family has been on LO since 3.x days and have not looked back.  More and more places now "know" about this great suite!  DONATE to it!
libreoffice~~~1414052277~~~drfits~~~5~~~After install libreoffice you MUST install libreoffice-gtk3 and libreoffice-gtk for correct window resizing working. После установки офиса ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО ставьте libreoffice-gtk3 или libreoffice-gtk чтобы избежать проблем с ресайзингом окна
libreoffice~~~1415203027~~~JCH2~~~3~~~Very clunky. Very locked in to Java (and tried different editions/versions with no effect). I really want to move more toward pure FOSS, but I cannot afford the lost time and wrestling when completing manuscripts for my publisher. I wait (again) for LO to mature.
libreoffice~~~1415511587~~~AUserInEssex2~~~3~~~At least some of the packages that this description seems to present as optional neem to be pre-installed.
libreoffice~~~1417561687~~~realist2000~~~5~~~In my opinion the best office suite.
libreoffice~~~1420054002~~~poet~~~4~~~I still need a WORDPERFECT solution for bookwriting ;-)
libreoffice~~~1421780566~~~michelsaey~~~5~~~Very good office suit replacement for Microsoft Office Professional!
libreoffice~~~1425699782~~~sirhobbes3~~~5~~~LibreOffice is pretty much my go to open/free office software. MS Office will pretty much always be the defacto thing to go to, as well as Office online that is offered through OneDrive and Outlook.com for basic needs. But for an actual program, LibreOffice works very well, and is very polished. Also is nice to be able to not have to use GDocs (which, honestly, sucks really really badly) on Linux distros that I don't have access to MS Office.
libreoffice~~~1422617110~~~mwright~~~5~~~Libreoffice 4.4.0 released - when can we see that in the Software Manager?
libreoffice~~~1423117222~~~carlatnip~~~3~~~old version!!!
libreoffice~~~1425204744~~~warlock2~~~4~~~Great program but little sad cause of not the latest version.
libreoffice~~~1424288822~~~flasdik~~~3~~~Not so good functional and optimization.
libreoffice~~~1425060771~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~The Standard in Free Office Suite
libreoffice~~~1424865532~~~kenubi~~~2~~~(calc,writer, 4.2.7.2) Kompletnie fatalny.  Używanie to męka, wszystko przeskakuje, źle zaznacza, znika magicznie z ekranu by po przewinięciu pojawić etc. mysz jakaś "tępa". Na ArchLinux jakoś lepiej działało, jak można pisać że jest "very good"? Tak fatalnej wersji jeszcze nie używałem.
libreoffice~~~1426351429~~~luisbraganca~~~4~~~Really nice but "Impress" should bring some default themes, and "Drawer" as well.
libreoffice~~~1426745676~~~danielbosse~~~2~~~Can`t understand the switchover to libreoffice. Installed openoffice again ...
libreoffice~~~1443950779~~~iosonoscrive~~~5~~~ok ok ok yes very best !!!
libreoffice~~~1427938951~~~signatux~~~4~~~¡Excelente paquete de oficina! Procesador de textos, hoja de cálculo, sistema de gestión de base de datos, etc. Sin embargo, en la web oficial ya está disponible la versión Estable 4.3.6 y ésta es la 4.2.7.
libreoffice~~~1428554749~~~Juan-Guillermo~~~5~~~Me gusta.
libreoffice~~~1429964072~~~steinit~~~5~~~Everything I need from an office suite. If they added somthing similar to OneNote I would be even more happy with it.
libreoffice~~~1433618398~~~OttoZ~~~5~~~ein echtes Geschenk, großartige Leistung - CALC ist ganz ausgezeichnet - SUPER
libreoffice~~~1435333200~~~matteo-quatrida~~~4~~~Suite Office di alto livello, paragonabile alle più blasonate a pagamento. Ho maggior esperienza con Writer e Calc e soprattutto in quest'ultimo rimpiango la possibilità di mandare i grafici in un foglio dedicato, funzione invece sviluppata in Gnumeric. Per questo motivo perde la quinta stella.

libreoffice~~~1451180189~~~Bugeater~~~5~~~I absolutely love it.  Better then MS Office
libreoffice~~~1451473715~~~Hammer459~~~2~~~The original, OpenOffice (by Apache Foundation), is far better in my opinion. Adding a metapackage to remove Libre would be beneficial
libreoffice~~~1451666819~~~essemme~~~5~~~Lo uso da diverso tempo con ottimi risultati, non fa rimpiangere MS Office
libreoffice~~~1453593296~~~mister_lister~~~5~~~I use it daily. I write for a living and it is a must have. Better and more versatile and easier than the crap that M$ puts out. Easy to navigate interface, works every time.
libreoffice~~~1454360417~~~bober~~~4~~~No it's not better than MS Office, but still good anyway.

libreoffice-base~~~1325973512~~~winlinuser~~~3~~~What works is good but there are stability issues.  Some tutorial material is out of date / incorrect.  It's no Ms Access but I like it and will continue using it.  Looking forward to future developments.

libreoffice-base~~~1366775403~~~Ahmad_istakim~~~5~~~like it
libreoffice-base~~~1389434850~~~ravenheart~~~5~~~Base is a great front-end for any database like HSQL, MYSQL, etc, BUT you MUST use a split format for stability.  Make sure you lookup the free templates online (they're actually in the openoffice.org forums, created by users Villeroy & DACM) for creating your databases in split format.  Make sure you know the difference between embedded & split databases before you begin working.  Split databases are not default, but give you rock-solid stability.
libreoffice-base~~~1407423107~~~spammeaccount~~~4~~~Why this is no longer included by default is beyond me. The launcher still has an entry for it. It embarrassed me when I went to show someone libre could also do databases
libreoffice-base~~~1424288796~~~flasdik~~~3~~~Not so good functional and optimization.
libreoffice-base~~~1437495912~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~Best & Free! But why it isn't in the default installation of the LibreOffice package is beyond understanding
libreoffice-base~~~1437812601~~~LinuxMinz~~~3~~~The programming language is pretty awful.

libreoffice-base~~~1443949214~~~iosonoscrive~~~5~~~Very good
libreoffice-base~~~1446518319~~~fotonix~~~1~~~Not in the default LibreOffice. Only shows one DB type on opening - HSQLDB Embedded, and cnnpot connect to newly created file. Here is hoping for Office 5 with Mint 17.3. Very disappointing. [I have 20 years+ experience in high end DB, this product deserves a Lord Torvalds torrent]

libreoffice-calc~~~1360565104~~~speaking_tree~~~5~~~I do not need more than 10% features of MS Office Suite  . So  dont see any need to spend any $$ on MS Office as Libreoffice is there
libreoffice-calc~~~1360847712~~~sujitnag~~~5~~~good one
libreoffice-calc~~~1365832268~~~ericvictor66~~~4~~~great
libreoffice-calc~~~1366422163~~~QreAtop_R3BaCk~~~5~~~Better then MS Excel!!!
libreoffice-calc~~~1376135892~~~rdelreLM~~~4~~~I use it normally. It is very good. Only, the management of macros and formulas might be better
libreoffice-calc~~~1378336609~~~stevewood007~~~5~~~Accepts more than 64k rows, unllike MS Excel.
libreoffice-calc~~~1383201600~~~MadTrapper~~~5~~~Whats not to like. Better than MS and can be used to unlock Excels locked sheets.
libreoffice-calc~~~1388514839~~~Korpu~~~2~~~Not a fan: after using Gnumeric, I find LibreCalc bothersome and unreliable: it changes copied/pasted dates at whim, copy-paste of other cells works reliably only if paster in entry filed at the top, not in cell (Mint 16 Cinnamon). Gnumeric worked better until it become unstable in new MInt. LibreCalc has more familiar and useful (for my tasks) environment than Calligra Sheets. Both have .ods file format and excellent import-export capabilities.
libreoffice-calc~~~1390636399~~~otolith~~~4~~~Still supports dBase files. Which comes in real handy if you need to edit Esri shapefiles.
libreoffice-calc~~~1392128830~~~evzen~~~4~~~Works quite well. However locale formating support needs to get far more flexible and reliable. Managed to make it so-so work for my locale, but time is displayed as a weird fraction when time is selected for editing.
libreoffice-calc~~~1396557529~~~james-burnby~~~1~~~I have a 16 gig of ram, quad dual-core, AMD10 set up. However Libre office seems to be extremely slow (minutes), even after tweaking settings. No other issues with other applications. If you have similar issues as myself then try gnumeric.
libreoffice-calc~~~1399171091~~~inolle~~~5~~~Amazing I havent used excel or msoffice in years since i discoverd libreoffice
libreoffice-calc~~~1400448423~~~l5d_~~~4~~~great alternative to Excel
libreoffice-calc~~~1401135923~~~ferretwilliams~~~5~~~When importing a csv file, Excel converted some item numbers to dates UPON OPENING. LibreOffice Calc kept them as-is. For importing CSV files, where you can't "just add an apostrophe" or "Just format it to text" because you're opening it, LibreOffice wins.
libreoffice-calc~~~1402651125~~~Lenon~~~4~~~Just like Microsoft Office Excel

libreoffice-core~~~1390302764~~~MarkB~~~4~~~I use it every day, but there are many compatability issues with Micro$oft office. For me, the main one is VBA code often needs a re-write to use. Having said that, these are also issues between different major versions of M$ Office. However, a compatability module would be good. That would encourage corporates to move into open source. Especially if a M$ like skin, mainly for menu items, could be wrapped around it.

libreoffice-writer~~~1328664867~~~Statik~~~5~~~Love this program. Use it and the other parts of the suite almost daily. Very capable. Especially happy with how it works with Microsoft files from the office.
libreoffice-writer~~~1328959758~~~lol23~~~5~~~works perfect. much better than openoffice
libreoffice-writer~~~1329003990~~~psyckers~~~5~~~Works very well and boots up in a second. Much nicer to use than MS Word and Open Office.
libreoffice-writer~~~1329763508~~~jose_manuel~~~5~~~LibreOffice Writer - the best word processor !!!!!!!!!!!
libreoffice-writer~~~1329978456~~~rangnar~~~4~~~Undisputable standard as Office Suite.
libreoffice-writer~~~1330397129~~~EricVictor~~~4~~~best alternative
libreoffice-writer~~~1330674578~~~-Marina-~~~4~~~Great word processor. Much nicer to use than MS Word. It would be perfect if it only had synonyms in the right click menu. Pressing Ctrl+F7 and searching for the alternative affects my productivity rates. It's much more complicated than I used to with MS Word. Otherwise perfect app! :)
libreoffice-writer~~~1331121793~~~Philpinch~~~5~~~Great word Processor indeed!
libreoffice-writer~~~1333252894~~~Mintification~~~5~~~LibreOffice Writer does an excellent job at word processing. It has great compatability options, and is much cleaner than MS Word.
libreoffice-writer~~~1333852816~~~frankhjung~~~4~~~Oracle did us a favour!
libreoffice-writer~~~1334231708~~~malfix~~~5~~~i love it
libreoffice-writer~~~1334681797~~~newpaul~~~4~~~Don't get me wrong, I have 3 pcs with Mint and would have 4 if one of my cats hadn't pissed on a nice & warm open laptop. But there is no practical use for everyone to keep saying that LibreOffice Writer is “better” than MS Word. Maybe better than Word 2003, and capable of matching Word 2007/2010 in many aspects, but not yet there. On a very immediate level, the customization paths are a tedious & redundant labyrinth. Backward stuff. The Review tools are still in a rudimentary state, and remain strangely hidden in the interface, even though I'm now able to move docx documents to and fro between MS-Word and LO-Writer keeping all the review info with no glitch whatsoever, in a professional environment. This is serious praise. Anyway, the MS Word Review layout is way ahead in features and productivity solutions. LO-Writer's proofing tools, as a whole, remain poor in comparison. I use LO-Writer in what I call the “Bauhaus Mode”, with no rule, no useless text boundaries, and no ugly toolbars. Just the basic menu. Nice. I was able to ditch Wine & an embedded Word 2007 to use LO-Writer exclusively in my Mint. That's how good it became. A simple request: if LO-Writer could create new empty documents locally, with a right click menu, that would make life easier to all those accustomed to other similar tools... and would be more intuitive.
libreoffice-writer~~~1335299647~~~jesus581819~~~5~~~Works well enough!
libreoffice-writer~~~1335329583~~~Simondererste~~~5~~~Just nice!

libreoffice-writer~~~1345663963~~~Ghermain~~~3~~~Ahora con la versión 3.6.0.2 puedo trabajar mejor todo lo que había elaborado con M$ y se me dificultaba, sobre todo con los PPS pero Impress funciona bien, algunas cosas no las muestra de acuerdo al original hecho con M$Off  pero es un gran avance.
libreoffice-writer~~~1345667386~~~Danko8321~~~5~~~Top Linux Office suite in the market. Probably one of the best word processors out there too.
libreoffice-writer~~~1346598623~~~aliendave~~~4~~~Libre doesn't seem to import layouts as well as AbiWord does.  Also AbiWord picks out more uk spelling errors i.e. both 'organized' and 'organised' are both correct but the one with the 's' is more common.  Similarly both 'customized' and 'customised' are both correct but the one with the 's' is again more common.  Sorry to nit-pick a perfectly laid out, stable and free program that'll still save the day when a machines down and you're broke! :)
libreoffice-writer~~~1348330443~~~Koljan~~~5~~~A good program

libreoffice-writer~~~1360565121~~~speaking_tree~~~5~~~I do not need more than 10% features of MS Office Suite  . So  dont see any need to spend any $$ on MS Office as Libreoffice is there
libreoffice-writer~~~1360690118~~~sirfalcon~~~5~~~Very nice but needs more compatibility with newer MS 2010+ format.

libreoffice-writer~~~1372310035~~~JasonPC~~~4~~~It's quite good, could with more features and it would be nice if it didn't distort my tables when I open a .docx file but not a big deal really, I can open most .docx files with out any problems and fix tables so all in all it is rather good actually.

libreoffice-writer~~~1394223487~~~George5~~~5~~~Used OOo under WinXP before coming to Linux 6 years ago. Switched to LibO as soon as it became available. Spellcheck works well but depends on languages installed and chosen. My PC runs in French and I spellcheck both in French and English.

libreoffice-writer~~~1449630153~~~alphekka~~~5~~~I use this in school everyday and have completely ditched MS Office since using this. I really like the little features which out-perform others. The only thing that is sometimes not working for me is when I start messing around with "Styles and Formatting" (F11). Sometimes it doesn't bring up the dialog. Not a show stopper, but I have seen that since I tinkered with vs. 5. I don't like any other office program suite though. Great work guys!

light-themes~~~1274537000~~~zens~~~5~~~If you like the themes in Ubuntu 10.04 like I do, install this theme. You won't be dissapointed.
light-themes~~~1274761491~~~dannyp32~~~5~~~This package includes the Ambiance and Radiance themes from Ubuntu 10.04 (the close, minimize, maximize are on the left side respectively).
light-themes~~~1302286036~~~JoeTheTechGuy~~~5~~~After testing Ubuntu 10.10 for a while, I really came to like the Ambiance theme (once I moved the buttons to the right) over the available Mint themes. But there was stuff in Mint that I didn't want to give up, so I downloaded this.  Now I have an awesome custom theme in Mint built around the Ambiance window border
light-themes~~~1307264824~~~RavS~~~5~~~Ambiance. One of the best themes available out there. Must try!
light-themes~~~1311518355~~~vonvalley~~~5~~~cool for Unity

light-themes~~~1386127722~~~salvo1118~~~5~~~Amazing theme.  Looks so great with Cinnamon that it has to be seen to be believed.  It should be standard on Mint.  I use Ambiance Window Borders with Adwaita Controls.  Great combination imho.

linphone~~~1413535809~~~Frugivore~~~5~~~I previously wasn't a fan at all but I re-tried a recent version (v.3.6 on Linux Mint 17 Qiana, XFCE) and most issues seem to be solved. You can call and text and keep records of both. You can also record the calls. Beware that it keeps history on a file in the HOME folder. With my not-so-fast connection the quality of the calls was good.

lm-sensors~~~1328208878~~~interferenc~~~2~~~No graphical user interface. The wiki wasn't clear to me on how to get started. Looks like it will take lots of time to get it working.
lm-sensors~~~1361825062~~~ulysses~~~3~~~Okay
lm-sensors~~~1364252910~~~fotonix~~~3~~~Basic "service" to feed data to apps that do the display work. My temps seem to report way above reality though (HP i7 laptop).
lm-sensors~~~1371199705~~~Voliax~~~5~~~Thank you! (this thing used by temperature showing applets or applications)
lm-sensors~~~1371793983~~~anomalice~~~2~~~Don't know how to use it.
lm-sensors~~~1379166292~~~drone12~~~1~~~Do you have a few hours to spend to try to figure out how to install this?  It does not appear in your menu after you download and install it with software manager, nor after you try to "apt-get install" it with the terminal.    I gave up and tried Psensor which installs instantly, appears in the "system tools" part of your start menu, and works great.
lm-sensors~~~1390187852~~~yudhaph~~~4~~~Like it. I run "sensors-detect" in terminal, and simply use 'hardware sensor monitor' panel applet to monitor.
lm-sensors~~~1398952805~~~chrismots~~~3~~~You just type "sensors" in the terminal and you get a reading. OK you can do more but that's a start.
lm-sensors~~~1405589038~~~Vupocy~~~5~~~This tool is able to read a lot of chips. Must be used a GUI software (ie: Psensor)
lmarbles~~~1427972277~~~josefg~~~4~~~Beautiful game. Challenging enough.

lmms~~~1420388663~~~resfilter~~~5~~~A very well done and effective music maker.  It's very much 'inspired by' FL studio, so if you've used it before, this will be second nature.

localepurge~~~1407971453~~~gcosta~~~4~~~Muy buen software, simple y util!. Very good software, simple and usefull!
localepurge~~~1423506932~~~MagicMint~~~4~~~If you’re sure about your language locale(s), it’s very handy, even if it looks archaic. You must install it as soon as possible after the installation of Linux Mint though, preferably before the very first update.
localepurge~~~1455618018~~~gloschtla~~~3~~~Purging of default locale en_US should be disabled, because certain software like samba depend on it: " Warning: No support for locale: en_US.utf8 " & "..no such directory"

logisim~~~1453841542~~~seanr~~~5~~~Excellent package.  I used it for 3 years to teach parts of Computer Architecture, but it can also be used to show many of the operations that happen 'under the hood' on a programming course.

lottanzb~~~1289923136~~~bcmalloy~~~5~~~Works perfectly every time no rar problem here best free newsleecher EVER
lottanzb~~~1300230628~~~KiLVaiDeN~~~5~~~Works flawlessly, you need to install unrar package for it to unrar correctly
lottanzb~~~1306872926~~~dinkyt~~~5~~~best nzb tool around :)
lottanzb~~~1334586964~~~kbits~~~4~~~Amending previous comment. Seems it keeps working in the background whilst any visible icons vanishes from taskbar, so you have no idea what’s going on.   Ran Task Manager and can see it still active; download has also progressed once you re-open the LottaNzb.   Do appreciate that you can set it to auto-unrar files, delete them (as well as the nzb). Nice.

lshw~~~1285791262~~~ceptor~~~5~~~mächtiges info-tool für techniker und supporter
lshw~~~1295506392~~~murmelbaer~~~4~~~Combined with lshw-gtk, a higly recommended tool to get profound information about your hardware
lshw~~~1311596100~~~bugz~~~4~~~Can be useful to fine tuning (i.e. kernel optimization for specified hw)
lshw~~~1332009738~~~fiver22~~~5~~~very detailed, small, and useful
lshw~~~1401547334~~~lcbulek~~~5~~~Muito bom, bem detalhista
lshw~~~1412748824~~~tonycstech~~~1~~~Doesnt LINUX OS comes with its own hardware information ?
lshw-gtk~~~1275157712~~~AndrewX192~~~3~~~Not the best interface and usability, but shows a lot of information. try "sudo lshw-gtk" if it complains about not being able to gather information as a normal user.
lshw-gtk~~~1276436065~~~afterburner~~~5~~~very nice one, more tools like this one would be nice
lshw-gtk~~~1285791247~~~ceptor~~~5~~~mächtiges info-tool für techniker und supporter
lshw-gtk~~~1290806367~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good tool for getting detailed hardware info.  Hardinfo is much more comprehensive, but this one's good too.

lshw-gtk~~~1307598328~~~Dreamcast000~~~5~~~Muuy bueno! Recomendable para saber la info de tu Hardware!
lshw-gtk~~~1309274649~~~MestreLion~~~4~~~Very nice! And truly hardware-oriented, unlike hardinfo, which focus way too much on software side (I dont care about free memory, IP connections, filesystems or kernel modules - I want to know my memory manufacturer, model, clock, etc!)
lshw-gtk~~~1314199314~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Needed
lshw-gtk~~~1320530101~~~Lugshar~~~4~~~It's a very good app though!
lshw-gtk~~~1371668749~~~Onikoroshi~~~1~~~Couldn't get it to run. Got this error: "Failed to execute child process "su-to-root" (No such file or directory)"
lshw-gtk~~~1385377243~~~bambitheslug~~~1~~~It didn't generate any results for my machine whatsoever. I recommend the "hardinfo" package as it works much better and is familiar from Mint 14 and earlier. I'm really surprised they didn't include hardinfo by default in Mint 15 or 16.
lshw-gtk~~~1396058362~~~jsalomonh~~~5~~~the best
lshw-gtk~~~1418909095~~~Peter_Kuykendall~~~4~~~Menu installer on Mint 17 is broken.  Right click the menu entry and change it to "gksudo -S lshw-gtk".  Works great once you fix the menu.

ltris~~~1350064484~~~vandu~~~4~~~Good game.
ltris~~~1366784748~~~fotonix~~~3~~~Is there a place to turn OFF multiplayer?
ltris~~~1370756703~~~Gxesio~~~4~~~Best tetris clone on the mintstore. The graphics are kind of excessible flashly though, especially on the menus.
ltris~~~1371785638~~~quake0~~~5~~~Great!
ltris~~~1377776181~~~Trond007~~~3~~~Oh Linux, I wish it was closer to the original.
ltris~~~1381039902~~~nurettin~~~5~~~I've been playing this game for years against the computer opponent. Great dexterity workout if you set it to 0ms delay and kamikaze play style.
ltris~~~1403441668~~~WoodyJesus~~~5~~~Very challenging version with excellent graphics!
ltris~~~1421036092~~~resfilter~~~2~~~Many subtle elements that you'd expect in Tetris gameplay are not present.  If you're a Tetris fan, you'll see what I mean.
ltris~~~1426175087~~~tak2100~~~5~~~Students love playing this one!
ltris~~~1443204166~~~harrygrey~~~5~~~Sehr gut gelungener Clone! Ein erweitertes TETRIS. Funktioniert sehr gut auch auf lagsamen Rechnern

ltsp-server~~~1401588619~~~bennabiy~~~5~~~Great for lab / shared computer environments. Actively developed and used by many in the greek schools, this is a wonderful tool!
ltsp-server-standalone~~~1401588472~~~bennabiy~~~5~~~There had not been much support for the unique setup which makes up Linux Mint (being technically labeled Ubuntu and LinuxMint) so needs either extra flags in the client generation process to allow for a linux mint Chroot to be generated for clients. As of Qiana, this should work out of the box. A testing PPA for linux mint support is available at ppa:bennabiy/testing which will contain specific bug fixes for linux mint, based on upstream code.

luckybackup~~~1284679294~~~foxesglacier~~~5~~~Excellent and advanced backup utility
luckybackup~~~1421678097~~~MagicMint~~~5~~~It’s a kinda swiss army’s backup tool. Although it needs some understanding, it covers all use cases from the beginner’s (in the basic configuration) to the specific needs of a nerd (with a fine-tuned configuration).
luckybackup~~~1290806589~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good backup utility with advanced features.  The way the settings are can be a bit off putting though.
luckybackup~~~1291107920~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~Works fast and well. But not very user-friendly nor eye-candy. i have got a problem with the deleting files on the destination : it doesn't works when the check box is on.  Too bad, it's exactly the feature i'm looking for!...
luckybackup~~~1292544211~~~hellnest~~~5~~~make rsync more easy to use :)

luckybackup~~~1312063806~~~Germmare~~~4~~~... i give it a try
luckybackup~~~1314241951~~~jajodo~~~5~~~More options than GRSYNC.  Great.
luckybackup~~~1315977121~~~minti~~~3~~~Lots of options, however, it would not allow to select destination from network drive or hidden file/folder, which may be a mounted NAS. Grsync works with network drives.
luckybackup~~~1321562800~~~kurgan~~~5~~~very good
luckybackup~~~1322059699~~~chassum~~~3~~~would be better if network drives were allowed

luckybackup~~~1363445433~~~green~~~5~~~In my book, the best backup (not imaging) app. Great if you, for example, have a backup of your music folder on another hard drive. If you just add some folders to your source folder, LuckyBackup only copies the added files.
luckybackup~~~1364145849~~~AshBaby~~~5~~~great
luckybackup~~~1367362287~~~fotonix~~~5~~~Backups should be this simple, and effective. Great GUI on top of tried, tested and trusted Unix utils.
luckybackup~~~1373039399~~~BITBox~~~5~~~Kudos to the dev team. What software should be. Simple, direct, and easy to run. Works every time for over a year now, for me. Nice.
luckybackup~~~1391825274~~~ravenheart~~~5~~~Great gui front-end for rsync & cron.  Simple to use & performs backups fast.  Easy scheduling.  Super user run available (which I use to maintain a backup of my entire home directory).  I use this rather than the Backup Tool that comes with Linux Mint 16, using their tool only for software selection backup.

luckybackup~~~1439239905~~~midtempo~~~3~~~Will not recognize devices connected as MTP such as a smartphone.  Since backing up certain data on a smartphone is so important (without synching everything to Google -- blecch), I consider this a serious flaw.  I am not sure what alternative program can backup MTP devices, and my Linux won't recognize my phone as USB mass storage.

lxde~~~1314199219~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Simple and yet works great
lxde~~~1314225599~~~rijnsma~~~5~~~Very nice desktop environment! It looks a little like Gnome 2.x and could be a great, speedy, light alternative..
lxde~~~1322085347~~~nagalman~~~4~~~Very lightweight and speedy, doesn't have the smoothness of gnome though
lxde~~~1323298745~~~WUAmin~~~5~~~simple and fast!
lxde~~~1326224957~~~jamvaru~~~5~~~much better than gnome or kde or xfce, but wheres my volume button?
lxde~~~1333780087~~~interferenc~~~4~~~My favorite over gnome, kde and unity. Is it because this one looks the most like Windows XP? Don't like all the default applications though.
lxde~~~1335554531~~~Myoh~~~5~~~very very fast <3
lxde~~~1337568731~~~MarkLaw19~~~5~~~I like it! Very fast and efficient..
lxde~~~1339024595~~~Mintification~~~5~~~Great DE. Lightweight and highly configurable.
lxde~~~1344161868~~~francheu~~~5~~~idéal pour les petites configs, boot en 1', deboot en 4" !
lxde~~~1349768429~~~quake0~~~5~~~Not just the best light desktop, but one of the best all around desktops.
lxde~~~1363782641~~~QreAtop_R3BaCk~~~5~~~Fast but not beautiful like Gnome Shell(I think). It's for slow PC.
lxde~~~1365532046~~~sujitnag~~~5~~~sweet

lxde~~~1375701271~~~miib96~~~5~~~super environnement trés facile à utilisé
lxde~~~1409435499~~~jahid_0903014~~~5~~~light weight
lxde~~~1415017489~~~dorchadas~~~5~~~Super quick, not as polished as Gnome or KDE but more than makes up for in speed, a definate for older PCs!
lxde~~~1425945391~~~lib2know~~~5~~~very puristic and tidy, fully reliable and unbelivable economic. It turns your legacy hardware which needs 15 minutes for a start under M$ to a useful working device; even the best choice for some occasionally started special purpose virtual machine which is planned to use between 256MB and 512MB RAM.
lxde~~~1446427783~~~onliniak~~~4~~~very speed, but not "search" in menu (Xfce, Mate etc) and Libre Office I have to instal in xfce
lxde-icon-theme~~~1308582553~~~gianpv~~~5~~~nice, fresh and Kde-style icon's

lxpanel~~~1272473546~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Because Openbox users need to dump PyPanel.
lxpanel~~~1281806507~~~stimuli~~~5~~~My fav panel for openbox. Useful, pretty, easy to tweak.
lxpanel~~~1300884861~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~A bit unfriendly when you try to configure it at the very beginning, but then it becomes a great tool. I suggest to use it with Openbox and PCManFM to create your custom lightweight desktop environment
lxrandr~~~1453231218~~~Mummel~~~5~~~Genau was ich gesucht habe.... Danke
lxsession~~~1349768587~~~quake0~~~5~~~works great for linux mint 12 lxde
lxsession-edit~~~1294076135~~~gianpv~~~5~~~the same application of gnome-session for LXDE desktop, usefull
lxsession-edit~~~1349768539~~~quake0~~~5~~~nice
lxsplit~~~1355363561~~~gloriousigor~~~5~~~Excellent to merge (append) many files into one. No need for GUI, because it can be used from within File Manager by adding a custom action. In Linux Mint Xfce's Thunar, use syntax "lxsplit -j %f" for all types of files matching *.001.
lxsplit~~~1390227173~~~ukuphila~~~3~~~When you use new Linux, use the terminal bash command "split" is faster and the best! Lxsplit is not fast as the default already have terminal bash command "split", Linux version of Hjsplit is unable to use, some other split file programs require Java, I searched for many split file programs! Run "split -b 100m filetosplit" to split big filetosplit to many 100m x?? files, run "split --help" and search for split command help! Run "cat `ls x??` > filetomerge" to merge into filetomerge, run "cat --help"! No others is better than "split"!
lxsplit~~~1418945649~~~newn~~~5~~~faster then HJSplit
lxterminal~~~1281806844~~~stimuli~~~4~~~Nice, light, fast terminal. Could use a few more options.
lxterminal~~~1287590947~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~I like it as it is: the lightest and the fastest
lxterminal~~~1303130958~~~RamboRan~~~5~~~Mr Burns said it :).
lxterminal~~~1340605455~~~Mintification~~~4~~~Not bad. Achieves its aims of being a lightweight terminal emulator quite well.
lxterminal~~~1401364880~~~fu-sen~~~5~~~It is simple, but can do it transparently in a background. I use it willingly.
lybniz~~~1346937098~~~stepan~~~3~~~too simple. sutable for kids. it's just R^2
lybniz~~~1285176520~~~gesthal~~~5~~~Lightweight.Really handy for a student like me.

lynx~~~1276923995~~~khai~~~1~~~Is still anybody using text browsers?
lynx~~~1282583697~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Good for accessing web pages from the terminal.  Solid and reliable, if you're looking for a text browser. Not the easiest to nagivate at first, but much smoother once navigation is learned.
lynx~~~1279926820~~~clem~~~5~~~Really handy if you need text-based browsing
lynx~~~1282728608~~~deBassplayer~~~4~~~fast. specially for text base information with lack of internet connection or small bandwith
lynx~~~1282731056~~~linux1492~~~4~~~Its good to have a text based browser in case you find yourself in troubles with X applications. Yes, it is good to have, same as it is good to have vim for a quick job on a script. Lynx is beating in terms of speed and basic internet requirements. Defently, it has its drawbacks based on the handling, but again this is only a question of experience with the application!
lynx~~~1282736337~~~French~~~5~~~Lynx a fine text based browser,take a look at my weblog http://frenchsite.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/webbrowser-in-de-terminal/
lynx~~~1288876543~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Cool :)
lynx~~~1291767425~~~merelyjim~~~5~~~There's a lot of stuff on the web that I can live without. When I go to a news site, I almost feel assulted by pics and video trying to grab more attention than the printed words. Lynx resolves this issue. Another win for the command line...
lynx~~~1295203212~~~Shostako~~~4~~~A good browser for the fanatics of CLI
lynx~~~1303369992~~~Fastraxx~~~5~~~I love this browser!
lynx~~~1303372217~~~wanda~~~2~~~Anybody using text browsers??.
lynx~~~1307818757~~~creation~~~5~~~nice browser when want to surf the web without banners; @wanda many people use text browsers
lynx~~~1311941439~~~RavS~~~3~~~Fun to try out, but I don't find it too useful.
lynx~~~1318835523~~~madalieninvader~~~2~~~"elinks" or "links2" are easier to use and prettier. only plus for lynx is that it might be better documented.
lynx~~~1324152559~~~daeme~~~5~~~great tool for the command line and script usage!
lynx~~~1324243094~~~kip-~~~3~~~good to see how crawl see your websites.. not other reason to have this..
lynx~~~1327819305~~~omecoatl~~~5~~~I've been using Lynx since 1996 and I love it. It removes all the clutter and it reminds me of the old days of the Internet. If you have Linux on a very old PC, this browser is fast as lightning.
lynx~~~1327846090~~~kwahoo~~~4~~~przydaje sie czasem

lynx~~~1397517313~~~m_holmes~~~4~~~I use it from time to time. I generally have it open on half a workspace along with X-chat
lynx~~~1401181684~~~Gnnomon~~~4~~~Exelente un navegador dese la Terminal
lynx~~~1424013338~~~MagicMint~~~4~~~Still useful in a terminal, e.g. for mc (Midnight Commander).
lynx~~~1424099069~~~cruizer~~~5~~~love it!
lynx~~~1426281591~~~lib2know~~~4~~~great formatted text rendering of websites and pdf files; handy saving as formatted text file; vi related control; good solution if history based browsing is sufficient and tabbed browsing is not needed
lyx~~~1274260669~~~farnaby~~~5~~~TeX for everyone.

lyx~~~1275326308~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~easy and yet powerful, increases your productivity!
lyx~~~1275645340~~~Tar-Minyatur~~~5~~~Since I found LyX I use it for almost everything. It's easy to use and produces very well presentable results. In some cases you need to dive into some messy details, but it's totally worth it.
lyx~~~1278332031~~~Klein1965~~~5~~~El mejor editor WYSIWYM (Lo que ves es lo que quieres decir) para LaTeX. El trabajo se hace más productivo y los resultados son profesionales.
lyx~~~1280930883~~~limulus~~~5~~~Works really well
lyx~~~1282746589~~~bobthedog~~~5~~~Need to navigate and edit a 50 thousand word document instantly? Lyx! In twelve years of using LyX I.ve never lost data, and I can't remember a crash. 'Nuff said.
lyx~~~1284742340~~~mjjzf~~~4~~~LyX is a remarkable tool which makes the muscles of the LaTeX system available for anyone. While there is no doubt it requires a bit of getting used to, your documents will be power user quality once you get into the mindset.
lyx~~~1288215042~~~30ctsparer~~~5~~~Easy to use and you can not only use, but even learn Tex
lyx~~~1288777586~~~yurielnf~~~5~~~The power of latex, but you can see what you are doing. I have used it for 3 years. It works on windows too.

lyx~~~1342384237~~~legodfrey~~~5~~~Brings latex to the masses
lyx~~~1348568457~~~wally~~~5~~~Superlative, no other accolade is appropriate: stands with the best that the Linux platform has produced, more than a word processor.
lyx~~~1351354444~~~ali20~~~5~~~awesome and simple to use
lyx~~~1351817951~~~Thorvald27600~~~5~~~Superbe!
lyx~~~1377772419~~~marknquinn~~~5~~~This is my favorite way to write/edit large documents. It is the best front end for latex and the most powerful tool out there for the creation of books, thesis, papers etc. You get the best of both worlds in terms of control and usability.
lyx~~~1361219308~~~Matt4179~~~4~~~I really like it alot.  I just wish there was a better way to check grammar .  It won't keep me from using it though.
lyx~~~1373734099~~~gerard_bekking~~~4~~~use it for a long time still the best editor
lyx~~~1378171236~~~anonimo115~~~5~~~I specially use lyx for building tables for latex. Easy to use, only import to latex code and paste in your latex document..
lyx~~~1384911233~~~gtaero~~~2~~~just get libre
lyx~~~1398053841~~~KefDS~~~5~~~Lo uso recientemente y es excelente

lyx~~~1411247092~~~Erebus_Oneiros~~~5~~~No need to compile everytime that you need to see the ouput, this saves time.
lyx~~~1420250556~~~diegoCode~~~5~~~Maravilloso!
lyx~~~1439820570~~~ManuelMB~~~4~~~Good. I use it to paste data (edit: special paste: plain text) into tables and then copy the code (view: fount code panel) to Texstudio.
lyx~~~1444034751~~~shiriak~~~4~~~I like it but... it saves documents in ".lyx" format only. Therefore if you want to save a document in ".doc" format it will be impossible unless you know how to change it. But I personally don't want to get into it. I  will better use another Word Processor.
lyx-common~~~1373733935~~~gerard_bekking~~~4~~~Once you got the hang of it it wil work all the time. Having said that, it is not very user friendly and if things go wrong in the layout it is hard to find the error for an average user (as I am). However it is my favorit editor now for more than I can remember (15 to 20  years now). Big plus is that althoug it takes a big effort to find errors the tutorials and help-files almost always deliver.
lzop~~~1281134820~~~silver~~~5~~~Middling compression ratio, but compression speed is often real-time.  This makes lzo great for shuffling around gobs of data, for when compression status is unknown, for data known to compress easily and well, etc.

marble~~~1377838819~~~cjrpackwood~~~4~~~An excellent learning tool! It shows much about the geography of our world, its cities and many of the roadways. I run it on LinuxMint 15 and Windows 7. Its not a replacement for GoogleEarth (satellite imagery), but does a great job in a scholastic manner.

marco~~~1408352939~~~WhitePhoenix~~~2~~~Why do you need both Metacity and Marco? They both do the same thing and it’s questionable that either is needed. OK, so it is needed, but you couldn’t combine the two?
marco~~~1429406128~~~5alafallah~~~1~~~I used mint 16 and it was ok here in 17.1 I suffered a longtime from "video tearing" tried a lot of online solutions, even I updated the kernel and comes from nowhere I find that "marco" here is the cause of this big problem...changed to compiz and video tearing vanished right away.

matchbox-keyboard~~~1372074033~~~discodick~~~2~~~For my purposes on Linux Mint Cinnamon 13, mostly useless. Too small to read. Couldn't re-size it or move it. Wouldn't show up in panel. Had to kill it with system monitor. Poorly designed, in my opinion.

mate-desktop~~~1386124161~~~salvo1118~~~4~~~Very nice!  I prefer Cinnamon a little more but I can see why Gnome 2 was so popular and why people wanted it more than Gnome 3.  Kudos to the Mint team for creating and supporting MATE
mate-desktop~~~1387315366~~~HappyMint~~~2~~~This doesn't work. I am running cinnamon and installed mate, but there's no selector at the login splash screen, it says installed but it's not doing anything.

mate-desktop~~~1425944166~~~lib2know~~~5~~~Extremly stable, beautyful and handy. MATE is the best choice for computers younger than Win7; for older computers Xfce might be a better choice; i prefer MATE on virtual machines for purposes which cause havy desktop use, cause it's smoother and nicer to the eyes.

maven2~~~1295552448~~~desertviper00~~~4~~~We use this everyday at work
maven2~~~1311823095~~~OnesimusUnbound~~~5~~~Best build management tool in the Java ecosystem.
maven2~~~1345499314~~~bblonski~~~4~~~Industry standard for building java projects.  Way better than ant.  It does take a bit of learning and can be a bit verbose for some simple tasks, but is very mature and widely accepted.  There are some alternatives, but none are quite as production ready as maven.
maven2~~~1385314096~~~lgringo~~~1~~~Obsolete package. Use maven instead
maven2~~~1391401779~~~Rezana~~~3~~~Hello can anyone help me install it?

mbw~~~1349054282~~~Niocora~~~5~~~Beautifly Simple! This is a very handy program. All you do is open a terminal, type mbw and a RAM amount in MB. Very helpful for figuring out how much RAM to give those demanding apps!
mc~~~1273957924~~~jkw~~~4~~~Use it over shell to a linux server and sometimes on my desktop to manage files. But I still miss good old Total Commander from time as a Windows User. Sure, there's gnome-commander and such, but they are far behind in functionallity.
mc~~~1274113612~~~vadi01~~~5~~~yea like total commander but less graphical. Ever since i began to use linux i put it in my 'must to have applications' list. Makes it easier to copy, delete, make files and directories from one place to another and link up to ftp servers.

mc~~~1314113135~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~good tool
mc~~~1311524786~~~bugz~~~5~~~I used to use that to manage my FreeBSD server as well as linux desktops. Not really anymore (using nautilus, gnome-do and console),  but if you need to manage file structures or had a habit to use FAR manager in Win before this would be great app for you.

mcomix~~~1408362438~~~Ion_ore~~~5~~~Much superior to Comix, which hasn't seen an update in 5 years. MComix can open PDF's and passworded archives, for example, and has more translations.
mcomix~~~1420638549~~~Rindo~~~5~~~just perfect.
mcomix~~~1428028768~~~signatux~~~5~~~Continúa allí donde Comix se quedó. Actualizado, soporta numerosos formatos e idiomas, y como ya  se ha dicho en otros comentarios, lee incluso archivos con contraseña. Elijo Mcomix, sin duda.
mcomix~~~1443550417~~~calhaus~~~5~~~The very best! Simple, lightweight, easy to use and good costumizations options. Yacreader is the second best, but lacks the zoom shortcuts and the view modes customization.

If you, dear author, think that you clarified us this misunderstanding with the name of thit program, you are mistaken! It is not so. All intrigue was near the abbreviation MDM.

me-tv~~~1436063743~~~johnniedoo~~~5~~~i need to update review,took me a while to figure out how to do this. I used my PCTV USB digital Pro 801 driver in ME-TV in a new box i built from AMD parts and it works perfectly. As soon as i plugged the usb device in, rebooted. me tv recognized it and found the channels i had obtained via terminal copy/paste instructions from noobs lab, i think or the ubuntu how to site.I get better reception with the same device on my linux computer than it does with the newest happaugue/pinnacle drivers,same antenna location , no idea why.but it works better, the EPG is fine and fast, channel changes are slow, but that is hardly a complaint. I do get tearing in some pictures i do not get on the windows PcTV driver/device. i try the standard, none and other options in prefs for deinterlacing with only worse effects that is the update.

mediatomb~~~1295049692~~~morbieus~~~5~~~Bought a new LG Netcast LCD TV. Only came with windows software to serve media files. No luck with the Nero Mediahome software under Virtualbox so went lookiong for Linux software and found this easy to use Mediatomb. The web interface makes selecting media folders easy. I have connected the TV via Ethernet cable.
mediatomb~~~1299926154~~~l1dge~~~5~~~Great piece of software. Works fabulousy, replace twonkymedia with this.
mediatomb~~~1316382584~~~xrdeem~~~3~~~Needs a GUI badly. As a noob and coming from Windows this is priority #1, and I'm sure someone with a bit of coding experience could get one up and running in a few hours if they tried. Had to search for hours on google for a step by step tutorial on installing it. After editing the config.xml file by typing sudo gedit /etc/mediatomb/config.xml and replacing "no" with "yes" in <server> <enable ui="no" ...> you have to do a sudo /etc/init.d/mediatomb restart in terminal. Only then will the MediaTomb admin page finally show up.
mediatomb~~~1318496209~~~djnes69~~~4~~~Es de lo poco bueno que hay en linux para el tema DLNA. Un aplauso para los desarrolladores. Seguid así.

mediatomb~~~1395735260~~~picassoz~~~2~~~Interface looks good, but I found it too much of a hassle getting permissions for other drives and devices. Actually found minidlna worked much better, although you've got to tell  it what to do and where to look. Syncs perfectly with my Nexus android, using BubbleUpPnp (on the android).
mediatomb~~~1399348832~~~tanuki~~~4~~~Bizarrely you have to edit a text config file to enable PS3 support, something that should just be enabled by default. The package installer also installs a faulty shortcut to the system menu. You have to run it from the Terminal, then edit the config file that appears in a hidden directory, then go to the web UI to add files. Even still, this is the only DLNA server that works at all for streaming mp4 video to my PS3. Plex and Serviio failed to stream anything and minidlna has bad buffering issues.

meld~~~1425430930~~~lib2know~~~5~~~great, simple to learn, even for people who never used diff. It's the other way around, it teaches to understand diff :-)
meld~~~1429217536~~~lamps~~~5~~~excelent
meld~~~1447157923~~~greggha~~~5~~~Very easy function; great for comparison, duplicate and directory comparison.
meld~~~1451667199~~~Beerforfree~~~4~~~Very nice, but slow and unresponsive on network folders
meld~~~1452866184~~~MintUser12345~~~5~~~Meld is bad for complex file comparison as you can't see inside the files. But you can delete or copy any file from any folder as you like. Kdiff3 is great for serious file comparisons as it has built in text viewers, I prefer Kdiff3's layout and method of merging into one folder but it won't let me delete files from one folder and not everything so here I am using Meld again as I want 3 separate folders without the same files, and Meld can do this.

mercurial~~~1316660160~~~notyourbuddy~~~5~~~Being new to Linux and coming from Window's Subversion Tortoise I thought I might run into trouble... but this versioning system is so easy to setup and use that I don't even bother grabbing a GUI frontend for it.  Checking out, commits, branches, and merges etc are such a breeze. Love it so much I even ditched Subversion in favor of Mercurial + command prompt when I need to work from a Windows machine!
mercurial~~~1323092307~~~ozcar~~~5~~~Used Mercurial to download the entire 700 Mb of Google's font directory. Simply followed the directions at http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ except used Software Manager to install Mercury.  Quite easy.  Thanks.

metacity~~~1270989514~~~Roin~~~2~~~I never understood why GNOME uses such a weak Window Manager.
metacity~~~1314125053~~~chumney_2000~~~5~~~Compiz lagged really bad on my quadcore with hd3200 gpu. I fixed it but it broke most of my system time to time. And i lost my workspaces, something i have been spoiled with when getting used to linux and android. Untill Compiz fixes this, I will stick to metacity. I am NOT the only one with the same problem. Thank you metacity for giving me a stable window manager, while letting me keep the extra features like workspaces I've come to enjoy. 5 stars, the lagging was really annoying and for a minute I ALMOST went back to windows 7. Metacity to the rescue!

micro-inetd~~~1412001329~~~inksi~~~4~~~It works. You must use the full path to your ftpd. It has to be fired up under sudo. It can be run in the background but then there are two processes to kill, check with ps. The second one will remain open and functioning. Best just to run it and squirrel the terminal away. The program is micro-inetd, NOT micro_inetd as in the minimalistic man page.

midori~~~1272781775~~~Grundoko~~~5~~~Gets a perfect score on the Acid Test 3, perfroms faster than any other browser I've used, has a simple but nice looking interface, and loads very quickly.
midori~~~1274221552~~~Mitzh~~~3~~~lack of functionality, but light
midori~~~1274763347~~~ddalley~~~1~~~Browsers must be able to display all pages and perform all functions on the page. Midori can't live up to that. If you can't access message editors on a forum, you're in trouble. This one needs more work.
midori~~~1274781116~~~huntman~~~4~~~it is OK
midori~~~1274933787~~~spayk~~~4~~~Great for low spec computers
midori~~~1275016143~~~thx1138~~~4~~~Fast and stable. Not that much functionality as FF, but as good as Chromium.
midori~~~1276923946~~~khai~~~2~~~Needs a LOT of developement to become a full & usable browser
midori~~~1277026145~~~thebrix~~~3~~~Very fast but basics need work - for example,
midori~~~1277376344~~~majortws~~~4~~~good but gmail only worked in basic html. Need work.
midori~~~1304893547~~~Xyie~~~3~~~A simple browser that's easy to use. Streamlined interface, works like Opera, feels like Firefox, light like Chromium. A bit unstable at times for now, however. must disable extentions and features to keep it from crashing.
midori~~~1279916816~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Great browser. Includes mouse gestures, keyboard shortcuts and many features. More lightweight than chromium.
midori~~~1280058600~~~turin13~~~3~~~Lightweight, but lacks some important futures, like password manager. Anyway, app worth trying.
midori~~~1283523637~~~JumaX9~~~5~~~Great!
midori~~~1286733509~~~patriki~~~4~~~Simple web browser. Enough features but lack of password manager and a better bookmarks manager... Fast.
midori~~~1290693803~~~shaon121~~~3~~~not bad
midori~~~1288876527~~~Elisa~~~3~~~Javascript doesn't work on some pages :-\
midori~~~1291412893~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~Not bad, but crashes constantly.  Needs work!
midori~~~1293300010~~~macrohard~~~5~~~klein und schnell
midori~~~1292311793~~~itonggant~~~4~~~lightweight, crash sometimes
midori~~~1293750435~~~RobinJ~~~4~~~Hmm... Nice homepage xD Error - file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html || It's a fine webbrowser, only things I miss is Java support (doesn't work for some reason...) and the CTRL+Enter thingy most browsers have (type in youtube, press CTRL+Enter, and it becomes youtube.com).
midori~~~1294847620~~~wanda~~~5~~~Fur mein Netbook klein , schnell und leicht dus ausgezeichnet.
midori~~~1294936165~~~grim~~~2~~~Lightweight, but keeps crashing :\
midori~~~1295105800~~~guv999~~~3~~~great potential in the future, not quite there yet.  Not straight forward to imprt bookmarks from other browsers for instance
midori~~~1296263337~~~eliofernandes~~~3~~~at list work very good on youtube videos
midori~~~1296398891~~~Koffeehaus~~~5~~~Excellent minimalistic touch. However for some reason I get the impression that Chromium is a bit faster. Am going to try it out and see how it flows on the long run. Default homepage isn't working as it is set for Ubuntu, not Mint. As for Ctl + Enter (see below), it has no use for European users, as it supports only .com domains; and not .co.uk for example.
midori~~~1296703336~~~Daiko~~~2~~~this browser is still in its infancy (version 0.2.8-1) and appears to be able to grow into something wonderful, but as of now is still immature and lacks the "Straightforward bookmark management" that is mentioned in the features list (which was disappointing). I prefer Chromium for its ease of use, powerful features and minimalistic style & design- I'll be removing Midori tonight and try other browsers in the meantime. I will give this browser a retake later on after it grows more though.
midori~~~1354076465~~~bicyclist56~~~3~~~В качестве запасного годится
midori~~~1297838188~~~surendra~~~3~~~?
midori~~~1298482896~~~namedaki~~~4~~~great job ;)
midori~~~1299928084~~~Inoki~~~1~~~Not really a fan of it. Crashed on first use and besides, if you want a really good Webkit web browser, either Epiphany or Chromium.
midori~~~1307109315~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~2~~~simple browser but there are better ones
midori~~~1308651556~~~Richard~~~4~~~léger comme il le faudrait pour tous les navigateurs
midori~~~1309529559~~~thor480~~~4~~~But it, crash crash
midori~~~1309531710~~~SeventhReign~~~1~~~Fast and Light .. and those are the ONLY good things about it.
midori~~~1311352270~~~peileppe~~~4~~~Tiny and Fast - don't be offended by the default homepage couldn't be found when you first open Midori
midori~~~1311857307~~~ali20~~~5~~~its very fast
midori~~~1311876309~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~very fast and lighteweight

midori~~~1316561315~~~gcosta~~~4~~~Es bueno,rapido, y algo mas liviano que Firefox.
midori~~~1318873878~~~perpipon~~~5~~~faster than chromium (crashes less!) version 4.1 avalaible on official website. can't wait the update!
midori~~~1319044966~~~mitanshugamer~~~5~~~Awesome , speedy and sleek . Check my review - http://ow.ly/72t7z
midori~~~1319233539~~~new2nix~~~5~~~incredibly fast, great web tools, nice features. Love It!
midori~~~1320075085~~~Karunamon~~~3~~~Very incredibly fast, but doesn't have necessary privacy functionality or a plugin system to provide it, and is not standards compliant.
midori~~~1327395856~~~D7rk~~~5~~~Fantastic. Some small, unimportant bugs.
midori~~~1329763379~~~jose_manuel~~~4~~~Great and Fast Browser !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
midori~~~1331924513~~~dmourgueth~~~5~~~muy bueno!!
midori~~~1332278787~~~SteveThePirate~~~1~~~doesnt even install in different distros
midori~~~1333807469~~~ulysses~~~3~~~Looking at all in all, then you must describe the browser more with 'moderate'.
midori~~~1337116953~~~krause~~~4~~~simples e eficiente
midori~~~1337611332~~~koltai~~~4~~~good!
midori~~~1337708547~~~horro~~~5~~~Works great!

midori~~~1347482600~~~coldfox~~~5~~~Very good!
midori~~~1348419007~~~tao_hunter~~~1~~~removed after 1st run, too slow and not support some flash video
midori~~~1349322585~~~arvislacis~~~5~~~One of my favorite browsers because of it's speed and less RAM usage. Good for lightweight desktops.
midori~~~1349877706~~~bomberman~~~5~~~fast and nice.
midori~~~1349884988~~~caerolle~~~4~~~I love Midori for its clean, simple design, and for its speed. I would make it my primary browser, except I want to have access to my bookmarks on several computers, including when I load a new distro and need to pull up info I have already collected. For that reason alone, I stick with Chromium.
midori~~~1350256432~~~naticc~~~3~~~me gusto, es rápido y ligero pero no puedo entrar a hotmail...
midori~~~1354666158~~~LohRampi~~~5~~~Leve e muito fácil de usar. Já está disponível ppa com a versão mais atualizada...
midori~~~1355233915~~~sroske~~~2~~~on LMDE 64 Mint 13, URL would not call up, and there were missing elements in the app window
midori~~~1356049789~~~Jessey-Lawson~~~5~~~Midori is one o the best browsers I have ever used on Linux. I think that if you have not tried it you should. It has no errors and it works great on youtube with Linux Min 14.
midori~~~1357982826~~~baztabroh~~~1~~~NOT SUPPORT PERSIAN
midori~~~1359294874~~~Kena~~~5~~~very nice
midori~~~1359551584~~~justinMINT13~~~5~~~works great, but as said before missing app elements missing in the app window on LMDE
